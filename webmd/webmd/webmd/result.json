{"topic": "Avascular Necrosis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis, is a condition that occurs when there is loss of blood to the bone. Because bone is living tissue that requires blood, an interruption to the blood supply causes bone to die. If not stopped, this process eventually causes the bone to collapse.\r\n        \r\n          Avascular necrosis most commonly occurs in the hip. Other common sites are the shoulder, knees, shoulder, and ankles.\r\n      \r\n        Who Gets Avascular Necrosis and What Causes It?\r\n        As many as 20,000 people develop AVN each year. Most are between ages 20 and 50. For healthy people, the risk of AVN is small. Most cases are the result of an underlying health problem or injury. Possible causes include:\r\n        \r\n          Dislocation or fracture of the thigh bone (femur). This type of injury can affect the blood supply to the bone, leading to trauma-related avascular necrosis. AVN may develop in 20% or more of people who dislocate a hip.\r\n        \r\n          Chronic corticosteroid use. Long-term use of these inflammation-fighting drugs, either orally or intravenously, is associated with 35% of all cases of nontraumatic AVN. Although the reason for this is not completely understood, doctors suspect these drugs may interfere with the body's ability to break down fatty substances. These substances collect in the blood vessels -- making them narrower -- and reduce the amount of blood to the bone.\r\n        \r\n          Excessive alcohol use. Much like corticosteroids, excessive alcohol may cause fatty substances to build in the blood vessels and decrease the blood supply to the bones.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Blood clots, inflammation, and damage to the arteries. All of these can block blood flow to the bones.\r\n        Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Gaucher's disease, an inherited metabolic disorder in which harmful quantities of a fatty substance accumulate in the organs\r\n          \r\n            Sickle cell disease\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas\r\n          \r\n            HIV infection\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy or chemotherapy\r\n          \r\n            Autoimmune diseases\r\n          \r\n          Decompression sickness, a condition that occurs when the body is subjected to a sudden reduction in surrounding pressure, causing the formation of gas bubbles in the blood\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Avascular Necrosis\r\n        In its early stages, AVN typically cause no symptoms; however, as the disease progresses it becomes painful. At first, you may experience pain when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become more constant. If the disease progresses and the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may experience severe pain that interferes with your ability to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and collapse of the bone may range from several months to more than a year.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment for Avascular Necrosis\r\n        The goals of treatment for AVN are to improve or ensure function of the affected joint, stop the progression of bone damage, and reduce pain.\r\n        The best treatment will depend on a number of factors, including:\r\n        \r\n          Your age\r\n          Stage of the disease\r\n          Location and amount of bone damage\r\n          Cause of AVN\r\n        \r\n        If the cause of your avascular necrosis is identified, treatment will include efforts to manage the underlying condition. For example, if AVN is caused by blood clots, your doctor will prescribe medications to dissolve clots. If inflammation of the arteries is responsible, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medicines.\r\n        If avascular necrosis is caught early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee, or ankle is affected, crutches may be necessary to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the affected joint mobile.\r\n        While these nonsurgical treatments may slow the progression of avascular necrosis, most people with the condition eventually need surgery.\r\n        Surgical options include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Bone grafts, which involve removing healthy bone from one part of the body and using it to replace the damaged bone\r\n          \r\n            Osteotomy, a procedure that involves cutting the bone and changing its alignment to relieve stress on the bone or joint\r\n          \r\n            Total joint replacement, which involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with a synthetic joint\r\n          \r\n            Core decompression, a procedure that involves removing part of the inside of the bone to relieve pressure and allow new blood vessels to form\r\n          \r\n            Vascularized bone graft, a procedure that uses the patient's own tissue to rebuild diseased or damaged hip joints; the surgeon first removes the bone with the poor blood supply from the hip and then replaces it with the blood-vessel-rich bone from another site, such as the fibula, the smaller bone located in the lower leg.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David  Zelman, MD on September 01, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            National Osteonecrosis Foundation: \"Osteonecrosis.\"\r\n            MedlinePlus.gov: \"Osteonecrosis.\"\r\n            Penn State Hershey Medical Center: \"Avascular Necrosis.\"\r\n            DukeHealth.org: \"Free Vascularized Fibular Graft.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Avian Flu", "content": "\r\n        What is bird flu?\r\n        \r\n          Bird flu is an infection caused by a certain kind of avian influenza virus. Although there are many kinds of bird flu, the most common kinds that concern health workers are H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses. These viruses are found in wild birds. Most of the time, wild birds don't get sick from the virus. But wild birds can easily pass the virus to birds that are being raised for food, such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The virus can cause them to get very sick.\r\n        Usually bird flu virus is not passed from birds to people. But since 1997, some people have become sick with this serious, deadly kind of bird flu. Most of these infections have been in Asian countries among people who have had close contact with birds raised on farms.\r\n      \r\n        What causes bird flu?\r\n        Bird flu is caused by a virus. After a wild bird infects a farm-raised bird, the virus can easily and quickly spread among hundreds or thousands of birds. Sick birds must then be killed to stop the virus from spreading.\r\n        People who come into contact with sick chickens, ducks, or turkeys are more likely to get the virus. Bird flu virus can be passed through bird droppings and saliva on surfaces such as cages, tractors, and other farm equipment.\r\n        Most people don't need to worry about getting sick with bird flu virus. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked chicken, turkey, or duck, because heat kills the virus.\r\n      \r\n        Why are people so worried about bird flu?\r\n        In a few cases, bird flu was passed from one person to another person, not from a bird to a person. But this was very rare. The bird flu virus can make people sicker than other kinds of flu viruses. Even though only a few hundred people are known to have been sick with bird flu, more than half of them have died.\r\n        Experts also worry because the bird flu virus is so different from other flu viruses that our bodies do not have immunity against it. Not having immunity means that our bodies have a hard time fighting the virus. It also means that anyone, including those who are otherwise very healthy, can get seriously ill if he or she gets bird flu.\r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        At first, the symptoms of bird flu can be the same as common flu symptoms, such as:\r\n        \r\n          A fever.\r\n          A cough.\r\n          A sore throat.\r\n          Muscle aches.\r\n        \r\n        Sometimes bird flu also can cause other symptoms, such as:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Vomiting or diarrhea.\r\n           An eye infection (conjunctivitis).\r\n        \r\n        Bird flu can quickly progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious lung problem that can be deadly. For the people who die from bird flu, the average length of time from the start of symptoms until death is 9 to 10 days.1\r\n        Call your doctor right away if you have traveled somewhere or live in an area where there is bird flu and you have a fever and a hard time breathing.\r\n      \r\n        How is bird flu diagnosed and treated?\r\n        If your doctor thinks that you may have bird flu, he or she will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms and past health. Your doctor will also ask where you live, where you have traveled recently, and if you have been near any birds. Then your doctor may order blood tests, nasal swabs, or other tests, such as X-rays, to help find out what is making you sick.\r\n        Some questions your doctor might ask are:\r\n        \r\n          Have you been within 3 ft (1 m) of live, sick, or dead poultry, or with wild birds?\r\n          Have you eaten raw or poorly cooked poultry or eggs?\r\n          Have you had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with someone from an area affected with a bird flu virus who has a severe respiratory illness or who later died from an unknown cause?\r\n          Are you a lab or poultry worker who might have been exposed to a bird flu virus?\r\n        \r\n        How bird flu is treated depends on what the virus is doing to your body. In some cases, antiviral medicines may help you feel better. But experts are concerned that certain antiviral medicines may not work against bird flu.\r\n        If you have bird flu, you will stay in a private hospital room (isolation room) to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to others. When your doctors and nurses are caring for you, they will wear gloves and gowns. Some people who have bird flu may need a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe better. Other people may need a machine to help the kidneys work better (dialysis). More than half of the time, bird flu leads to death.\r\n      Continued\r\n        How can bird flu be prevented?\r\n         The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are preparing for the possibility that bird flu could spread to people all over the world in what is called a pandemic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved human vaccines to protect against bird flu. But immunization is not available for the public right now. The vaccines are kept in a U.S. government stockpile.2 Officials are also storing up large supplies of antiviral medicines. The U.S. government has also developed a flu plan. This is a plan to prepare for a pandemic and to make sure that as few people as possible get the virus.\r\n        International health organizations now require that all infected birds be killed. Some countries have programs to clean up poultry farms and to check that all birds are healthy before they are sold. In 2004, the United States stopped buying poultry from most Asian countries.\r\n         Even though there is a lot of talk about bird flu, most people in the United States don't have to worry about getting it. As of April 2012, no cases of bird flu in humans had been found in the U.S. But you can take steps to lower your chances of getting infected.\r\n        \r\n          If you live in an area with bird flu, or if you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu: Avoid poultry farms, poultry-processing factories or plants, and close contact with chickens, turkeys, or ducks.Stay away from open-air markets where live birds are sold.\r\n          If you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu, ask your doctor about getting a regular flu shot. It is best to do this at least 2 weeks before you leave. This will not prevent bird flu, but it may help you avoid getting the regular flu.\r\n          Keep your hands clean by washing them often with soap and warm water or using a hand gel that kills germs. If you use a hand gel, be sure to buy only gels made with alcohol. They do the best job of cleaning your hands.\r\n          Do not eat raw or poorly cooked eggs or poultry. But you can safely eat fully cooked eggs and fully cooked chicken, duck, and turkey, because heat kills the virus.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Latest information about avian influenza\r\n        These organizations are studying and keeping track of bird flu, including what is being done to prevent its spread.

{"topic": "Appendicitis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a 3 1/2-inch-long tube of tissue that extends from the large intestine. No one is absolutely certain what the function of the appendix is. One thing we do know: We can live without it, without apparent consequences.\r\n        Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgery to remove the appendix. Left untreated, an inflamed appendix will eventually burst, or perforate, spilling infectious materials into the abdominal cavity. This can lead to peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the abdominal cavity's lining (the peritoneum) that can be fatal unless it is treated quickly with strong antibiotics.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Sometimes a pus-filled abscess (infection that is walled off from the rest of the body) forms outside the inflamed appendix. Scar tissue then \"walls off\" the appendix from the rest of the abdomen, preventing infection from spreading. An abscessed appendix is a less urgent situation, but unfortunately, it can't be identified without surgery. For this reason, all cases of appendicitis are treated as emergencies, requiring surgery.\r\n        In the U.S., one in 15 people will get appendicitis. Although it can strike at any age, appendicitis is rare under age 2 and most common between ages 10 and 30.\r\n        \r\n          What Causes Appendicitis?\r\n        \r\n        Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes blocked, often by stool, a foreign body, or cancer. Blockage may also occur from infection, since the appendix swells in response to any infection in the body.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          What Are the Symptoms of Appendicitis?\r\n        \r\n        The classic symptoms of appendicitis include:\r\n        \r\n          Dull pain near the navel or the upper abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen. This is usually the first sign.\r\n          Loss of appetite\r\n          Nausea and/or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins\r\n          Abdominal swelling\r\n          Fever of 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit\r\n          Inability to pass gas\r\n        \r\n        Almost half the time, other symptoms of appendicitis appear, including:\r\n        \r\n          Dull or sharp pain anywhere in the upper or lower abdomen, back, or rectum\r\n          \r\n            Painful urination\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Vomiting that precedes the abdominal pain\r\n          Severe cramps\r\n          \r\n            Constipation or diarrhea with gas\r\n        \r\n        If you have any of the mentioned symptoms, seek medical attention immediately, because timely diagnosis and treatment is very important. Do not eat, drink, or use any pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture.\r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          How Is Appendicitis Diagnosed?\r\n        \r\n        Diagnosing appendicitis can be tricky. Symptoms of appendicitis are frequently vague or extremely similar to other ailments, including gallbladder problems, bladder or urinary tract infection, Crohn's disease, gastritis, intestinal infection, and ovary problems.\r\n        The following tests are usually used to make the diagnosis:\r\n        \r\n          Abdominal exam to detect inflammation\r\n          \r\n            Urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection\r\n          \r\n            Rectal exam\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Blood test to see if your body is fighting infection\r\n          CT scans and/or ultrasound\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          How Is Appendicitis Treated?\r\n        \r\n        Surgery to remove the appendix, which is called an appendectomy, is the standard treatment for appendicitis.\r\n        Generally, if appendicitis is suspected, doctors tend to err on the side of safety and quickly remove the appendix to avoid its rupture. If the appendix has formed an abscess, you may have two procedures: one to drain the abscess of pus and fluid, and a later one to remove the appendix. However, there is some research showing that treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics may eliminate the need for surgery.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Appendectomy: What to Expect\r\n        Antibiotics are given before an appendectomy to fight possible peritonitis. General anesthesia is usually given, and the appendix is removed through a 4-inch incision or by laparoscopy. If you have peritonitis, the abdomen is also irrigated and drained of pus.\r\n        Within 12 hours of surgery you may get up and move around. You can usually return to normal activities in two to three weeks. If surgery is done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen), the incision is smaller and recovery is faster.\r\n        After an appendectomy, call your doctor if you have:\r\n        \r\n          Uncontrolled vomiting\r\n          Increased pain in your abdomen\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness/feelings of faintness\r\n          \r\n            Blood in your vomit or urine\r\n          Increased pain and redness in your incision\r\n          Fever\r\n          Pus in the wound\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Can Appendicitis Be Prevented?\r\n        \r\n        There is no way to prevent appendicitis. However, appendicitis is less common in people who eat foods high in fiber, such as fresh fruits and vegetables.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 30, 2014\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Di Saverio, S.

{"topic": "Arrhythmia", "content": "\r\n        \"Arrhythmia\" means your heartbeat is irregular. It doesn't necessarily mean your heart is beating too fast or too slow. It just means it's out of its normal rhythm.\r\n        It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, is \"fluttering,\" or is beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or, you might not notice anything, since some arrhythmias are \"silent.\"\r\n        Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they may be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, call 911 so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it.\r\n      \r\n        Causes and Types of of Arrhythmias\r\n        You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. Or it could happen because you have:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Heart disease\r\n          \r\n          The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood\r\n          Changes in your heart muscle\r\n          Injury from a heart attack\r\n          Healing process after heart surgery\r\n        \r\n        The many types of arrhythmias include:\r\n        \r\n          Premature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats that start in the heart's upper chambers, called the atria. They are harmless and generally don't need treatment.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These are among the most common arrhythmias. They're the \"skipped heartbeat\" we all occasionally feel. They can be related to stress or too much caffeine or nicotine. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. If you have a lot of PVCs, or symptoms linked to them, see a heart doctor (cardiologist).\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Atrial fibrillation. This common irregular heart rhythm causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally.\r\n        \r\n          Atrial flutter. This is an arrhythmia that's usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. It happens most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often changes to atrial fibrillation.\r\n        \r\n          Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, starting from above the heart's lower chambers, or ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly.\r\n        \r\n          Accessory pathway tachycardias. You can get a rapid heart rate because there is an extra pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers. It's just like if there was an extra road on your way home as well as your usual route, so cars can move around faster. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast heart rhythm, which doctors call tachycardia. The impulses that control your heart rhythm travel around the heart very quickly, making it beat unusually fast.\r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. This is another type of fast heartbeat. It's caused by there being an extra pathway through a part of the heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In some cases, you can stop it simply by breathing in and bearing down. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm.\r\n        \r\n          Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). A rapid heart rhythm starting from the heart's lower chambers. Because the heart is beating too fast, it can't fill up with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia -- especially in people with heart disease -- and it may be linked to other symptoms.\r\n        \r\n          Ventricular fibrillation. This happens when the heart's lower chambers quiver and can't contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible.\r\n        \r\n          Long QT syndrome. This may cause potentially dangerous arrhythmias and sudden death. Doctors can treat it with medications or devices called defibrillators.\r\n        \r\n          Bradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms, which may be due to disease in the heart's electrical system. If you experience this, call your doctor.\r\n        \r\n          Sinus node dysfunction. This slow heart rhythm is due to a problem with the heart's sinus node. Some people with this type of arrhythmia need a pacemaker.\r\n        \r\n          Heart block. There is a delay or a complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the heart's sinus node to its lower chambers. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. In serious cases, you'd get a pacemaker.\r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Arrhythmias\r\n        An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. A doctor can find an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse or through an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).\r\n        If you do have symptoms, they may include:\r\n        \r\n          Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heart beats, fluttering or \"flip-flops\")\r\n          Pounding in your chest\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness or feeling light-headed\r\n          Fainting\r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n          \r\n            Chest pain or tightness\r\n          \r\n            Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired)\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Diagnosis of Arrhythmias\r\n        To diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests including:\r\n        \r\n          Electrocardiogram -- Also called an EKG or ECG, this test records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office.\r\n        \r\n          Holter monitor -- This is a portable EKG that you'll use for 1 to 2 days. You'll have electrodes taped to your skin. It's painless and you can do everything but shower while wearing the electrodes.\r\n        \r\n          Event monitor -- If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest you wear one of these, usually for about a month. This is a device that, when you push a button, will record and store your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Each time you notice symptoms, you should try to get a reading on the monitor. Your doctor will interpret the results.\r\n        \r\n          Stress test -- There are different kinds of stress tests. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a heart rhythm problem or not getting enough blood flow to the heart. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty while you're getting an EKG and getting your heart rate and blood pressure monitored.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Echocardiogram\r\n          -- This test uses ultrasound to evaluate heart muscle and heart valves.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Cardiac catheterization\r\n          -- Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. She will guide it to your heart with help from a special X-ray machine. Then she'll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart's valves, coronary arteries, and chambers.\r\n        \r\n          Electrophysiology study -- This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which controls it best, or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it.\r\n        \r\n          Head-up tilt table test -- Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up or lying down. You'll get this test in a lab. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you're getting an EKG and specialists are checking your blood pressure and oxygen level.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment of Arrhythmias\r\n        Treatment depends on the type and seriousness of your arrhythmia. Some people with arrhythmias don't need treatment. Others may need medication, making lifestyle changes, and surgery.\r\n        Drugs that treat arrhythmias include:\r\n        \r\n          Antiarrhythmic drugs. These drugs control heart rhythm and include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.\r\n        \r\n          Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. These drugs lower the risk of blood clots and stroke. These include the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin. Other blood thinners called apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) have been approved to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation.\r\n        Everyone is different. Finding the medicine and dose that works best for you may take some time.\r\n        \r\n          If you notice that your arrhythmia happens more often with certain activities, stop doing them.\r\n          If you smoke, stop.\r\n          Limit alcohol to no more than one drink a day for women, and two drinks a day for men.\r\n          Limit or stop using caffeine.\r\n          Don't use cough and cold medications that have stimulants. Read the label and ask your doctor or pharmacist what medication would be best for you.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What Is Electrical Cardioversion?\r\n        If drugs can't control a persistent irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, doctors, give you a short-acting anesthesia, then deliver an electrical shock to your chest wall to allow the normal rhythm to restart.\r\n      \r\n        What Is a Pacemaker?\r\n        This device sends small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. The pacemaker has a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and wires that send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle.\r\n      \r\n        What Is an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)?\r\n        Doctors mainly use ICDs to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms.\r\n        The ICD constantly tracks the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. There are several ways the ICD can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. They include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). When the heart beats too fast, you get a series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Cardioversion. You may get a low-energy shock at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Defibrillation. When the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly, the heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a normal rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Anti-bradycardia pacing. Many ICDs provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        What Is Catheter Ablation?\r\n        You can think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem within the heart.\r\n        The doctor will insert a catheter through the leg. The catheter delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside the heart that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy \"disconnects\" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm.\r\n        Doctors use ablation to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Some people also need other procedures.\r\n      \r\n        Heart Surgery for Arrhythmias\r\n        The Maze procedure is a type of surgery used to correct atrial fibrillation. During this procedure, the surgeon makes a series, or \"maze,\" of cuts in the heart's upper chambers. The goal is to keep the heart's electrical impulses only on certain pathways. Some people may need a pacemaker afterward.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Jennifer  Robinson, MD on April 21, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCE:\r\n            News release, FDA.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Ankle Osteoarthritis", "content": "\r\n        As you age, your chance of developing osteoarthritis, which is caused by wear and tear, increases. The joint damage associated with osteoarthritis causes swelling, pain, and deformity. Here is information about how osteoarthritis affects the foot and ankle and information you can use to help you manage this debilitating condition.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Arthritis?\r\n        \r\n          Arthritis is a general term for a group of more than 100 diseases. The word \"arthritis\" means \"joint inflammation.\" Arthritis involves inflammation and swelling in and around the body's joints and surrounding soft tissue. The inflammation can cause pain and stiffness.\r\n        In many kinds of arthritis, progressive joint deterioration occurs and the smooth \"cushioning\" cartilage in joints is gradually lost. As a result, the bones rub and wear against each other. Soft tissues in the joints also may begin to wear down. Arthritis can be painful and eventually result in limited motion, loss of joint function, and deformities in the joints affected.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Osteoarthritis?\r\n        \r\n          Osteoarthritis, or \"wear-and-tear\" arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis. Also known as degenerative joint disease or age-related arthritis, osteoarthritis is more likely to develop as people age. Inflammation and injury to the joint cause a breaking down of cartilage tissues, resulting in pain, swelling, and deformity. The changes in osteoarthritis usually occur slowly over many years, though there are occasional exceptions.\r\n      \r\n        How Does Osteoarthritis Affect the Foot and Ankle?\r\n        Each foot has 28 bones and more than 30 joints. The following are the most common foot joints affected by osteoarthritis:\r\n        \r\n          The three joints of the foot that involve the heel bone, the inner mid-foot bone, and the outer mid-foot bone\r\n          The joint of the big toe and foot bone\r\n          The joint where the ankle and shinbone meet\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What Are the Symptoms of Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis?\r\n        Symptoms of foot and ankle osteoarthritis often include:\r\n        \r\n          Tenderness or pain\r\n          Reduced ability to move, walk, or bear weight\r\n          Stiffness in the joint\r\n          Swelling in the joint\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        How Is Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Diagnosed?\r\n        The diagnosis of foot and ankle osteoarthritis most likely will involve:\r\n        \r\n          A medical history\r\n          \r\n            Physical exam\r\n          \r\n          X-rays\r\n          \r\n            Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scans\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        How Is Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Treated?\r\n        Foot and ankle osteoarthritis can be treated in many ways. Nonsurgical methods to treat foot and ankle arthritis include:\r\n        \r\n          Steroid medications injected into the joints\r\n          Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the joints\r\n          Pain relievers\r\n          Pads or arch supports\r\n          Canes or braces to support the joints\r\n          Inserts that support the ankle and foot (orthotics)\r\n          \r\n            Physical therapy\r\n          \r\n          Custom shoes\r\n          \r\n            Weight control\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Tips on Foot Care With Osteoarthritis\r\n        The most essential element of foot care for people with foot and ankle osteoarthritis is to wear shoes that fit properly and feel comfortable. The following are things to look for in finding a comfortable shoe:\r\n        \r\n          Shoes shaped like your foot\r\n          Shoes that have support -- for example, no slip-on shoes\r\n          Rubber soles to provide more cushioning\r\n          Flexibility\r\n          Proper fit -- ask the salesperson to help you with this\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Exercise can help keep your feet pain-free, strong, and flexible. Exercises that can be good for your feet include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Achilles stretch. With your palms flat on a wall, lean against the wall and place one foot forward and one foot back. Lean forward, leaving your heels on the floor. You can feel the pull in your Achilles tendon and your calf. Repeat this exercise three times, holding for 10 seconds on each repeat.\r\n          \r\n            Big-toe stretch. Place a thick rubber band around your big toes. Pull the big toes away from each other and toward the other toes. Hold this position for five seconds and repeat the exercise 10 times.\r\n          \r\n            Toe pull. Place a rubber band around the toes of each foot, and then spread your toes. Hold this position for five seconds and repeat the exercise 10 times.\r\n          \r\n            Toe curl. Pick up marbles with your toes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Is Surgery an Option for Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis?\r\n        More than one kind of surgery may be required to treat foot and ankle osteoarthritis. Your doctor can select the kind of surgery that is best for you, depending on the extent of your arthritis. The following are some of the surgical options for foot and ankle osteoarthritis:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fusion surgery. This kind of surgery, also called arthrodesis, involves fusing bones together with the use of rods, pins, screws, or plates. After healing, the bones remain fused together.\r\n          \r\n            Joint replacement surgery. This kind of surgery involves replacing the ankle joint with artificial implants and is used only in rare cases.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David  Zelman, MD on July 20, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS): \"What Is Osteoarthritis?\" and \"Hand Out on Health: Osteoarthritis.\"\r\n            National Institute on Aging: \"Age Page: Arthritis Advice.\"\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Anal Abscess", "content": "\r\n        An anal abscess is a painful condition in which a collection of pus develops near the anus. Most anal abscesses are a result of infection from small anal glands.\r\n        The most common type of abscess is a perianal abscess. This often appears as a painful boil-like swelling near the anus. It may be red in color and warm to the touch. Anal abscesses located in deeper tissue are less common and may be less visible.\r\n        Surgical incision and drainage is the most common treatment for all types of anal abscesses and is usually successful.\r\n        About 50% of patients with an anal abscess will develop a complication called a fistula. A fistula is a small tunnel that makes an abnormal connection between the site of the abscess and the skin.\r\n        In some cases, an anal fistula causes persistent drainage. In other cases, where the outside of the tunnel opening closes, the result may be recurrent anal abscesses. Surgery is needed to cure almost all anal fistulas.\r\n      \r\n        Causes of Anal Abscesses\r\n        An anal abscess can have many different causes. These include:\r\n        \r\n          Infection of an anal fistula. An anal fistula is a small superficial tear in the skin of the anal canal.\r\n          Sexually transmitted infections.\r\n          Blocked anal glands.\r\n        \r\n        Risk factors for anal abscesses include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Colitis\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\r\n          \r\n            Diabetes\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Diverticulitis\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Pelvic inflammatory disease\r\n          \r\n          Being the receptive partner in anal sex\r\n          Use of medications such as prednisone\r\n        \r\n        For adults, using condoms during sexual intercourse, including anal intercourse, can help prevent anal abscesses. For infants and toddlers, frequent diaper changes and proper cleaning during diaper changes can help prevent anal fistulas and perianal abscesses.\r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Superficial anal abscesses are often associated with:\r\n        \r\n          Pain, which is usually constant, throbbing, and worse when sitting down\r\n          Skin irritation around the anus, including swelling, redness, and tenderness\r\n          Discharge of pus\r\n          \r\n            Constipation or pain associated with bowel movements\r\n        \r\n        Deeper anal abscesses may also be associated with:\r\n        \r\n          Fever\r\n          Chills\r\n          Malaise\r\n        \r\n        Sometimes, fever is the only symptom of deep anal abscesses.\r\n      \r\n        Diagnosis of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Usually, a clinical evaluation -- including a digital rectal exam -- is sufficient to diagnose an anal abscess. But some patients may require additional tests to screen for:\r\n        \r\n          Sexually transmitted infections\r\n          \r\n            inflammatory bowel disease\r\n          \r\n          Diverticular disease\r\n          \r\n            Rectal cancer\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        In rare cases, an examination may be done under anesthesia. The doctor may also ask for an ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Prompt surgical drainage is important, preferably before the abscess erupts. Superficial anal abscesses can be drained in a doctor's office using a local anesthetic. Large or deeper anal abscesses may require hospitalization and the assistance of an anesthesiologist.\r\n        After the procedure, most people are prescribed medications for pain relief. For otherwise healthy people, antibiotics are usually not needed. Antibiotics may be required, though, for some people, including those with diabetes or decreased immunity.\r\n        Sometimes, fistula surgery can be performed at the same time as abscess surgery. However, fistulas often develop four to six weeks after an abscess is drained. Sometimes a fistula may not occur until months or even years later. So fistula surgery is usually a separate procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis or with a short hospital stay.\r\n        After abscess or fistula surgery, discomfort is usually mild and can be controlled with pain medications. People can expect to lose only a minimal amount of time from work or school.\r\n        People are usually advised to soak the affected area in a warm water (sitz) bath three or four times per day. Stool softeners may be recommended to ease the discomfort of bowel movements. Some people may be advised to wear a gauze pad or mini-pad to prevent the drainage from soiling their clothes.\r\n        Complications after surgery can include:\r\n        \r\n          Infection\r\n          \r\n            Anal fissure\r\n          \r\n          An abscess returning\r\n          Scarring\r\n        \r\n        After an anal abscess or fistula has properly healed, it's unlikely that the problem will come back. To prevent one from doing so, however, it's important to follow the advice of your doctor or colon and rectal surgeon.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Melinda  Ratini, DO, MS on September 01, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Merck Manual Professional: \"Anorectal Abscess.\"\r\n            Patient.co.uk: \"Anorectal Abscess.\"\r\n            American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons: \"Anal Abscess/Fistula.\"\r\n            MyClevelandClinic.org: \"Anal Abscesses/Fistulae Overview.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Anemia", "content": "\r\n        What Is Anemia?\r\n        \r\n          Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.\r\n        \r\n          Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:\r\n        \r\n          Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.\r\n          Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.\r\n          Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.\r\n        \r\n        There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.\r\n      \r\n        What Causes Anemia?\r\n        There are more than 400 types of anemia, which are divided into three groups:\r\n        \r\n          Anemia caused by blood loss\r\n          Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production\r\n          Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Blood Loss\r\n        Red blood cells can be lost through bleeding, which often can occur slowly over a long period of time, and can go undetected. This kind of chronic bleeding commonly results from the following:\r\n        \r\n          Gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers,hemorrhoids,gastritis(inflammation of thestomach), andcancer\r\n          Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asaspirinoribuprofen, which can cause ulcers and gastritis\r\n          \r\n            Menstruationandchildbirthin women, especially if menstrual bleeding is excessive and if there are multiple pregnancies\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Decreased or Faulty Red Blood Cell Production\r\n        With this type of anemia, the body may produce too few blood cells or the blood cells may not function correctly. In either case, anemia can result. Red blood cells may be faulty or decreased due to abnormal red blood cells or a lack of minerals andvitaminsneeded for red blood cells to work properly. Conditions associated with these causes of anemia include the following:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Sickle cell anemia\r\n          \r\n          Iron-deficiency anemia\r\n          Vitamin deficiency\r\n          Bone marrow and stem cell problems\r\n          Other health conditions\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sickle cell anemiais an inherited disorder that, in the U.S. affects mainly African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Red blood cells become crescent-shaped because of a genetic defect. They break down rapidly, so oxygen does not get to the body's organs, causing anemia. The crescent-shaped red blood cells can also get stuck in tiny blood vessels, causingpain.\r\n        \r\n          Iron-deficiency anemiaoccurs because of a lack of the mineral iron in the body. Bone marrow in the center of the bone needs iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that transports oxygen to the body's organs. Without adequate iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. The result is iron-deficiency anemia. This type of anemia can be caused by:\r\n        \r\n          An iron-poor diet, especially in infants, children,teens, vegans, and vegetarians\r\n          The metabolic demands of pregnancy andbreastfeedingthat deplete a woman's iron stores\r\n          \r\n            Menstruation\r\n          \r\n          Frequentblood donation\r\n          Endurance training\r\n          Digestive conditions such asCrohn's diseaseor surgical removal of part of the stomach or small intestine\r\n          Certain drugs, foods, and caffeinated drinks\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Vitamin-deficiency anemiamay occur whenvitamin B12and folate are deficient. These twovitaminsare needed to make red blood cells. Conditions leading to anemia caused by vitamin deficiency include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Megaloblastic anemia: Vitamin B12 or folate or both are deficient\r\n          \r\n            Pernicious anemia: Poor vitamin B12 absorption caused by conditions such asCrohn's disease, an intestinal parasite infection, surgical removal of part of the stomach or intestine, or infection withHIV\r\n          Dietary deficiency: Eating little or no meat may cause a lack of vitamin B12, while overcooking or eating too few vegetables may cause a folatedeficiency.\r\n          Other causes of vitamin deficiency: pregnancy, certainmedications,alcohol abuse, intestinal diseases such astropical sprueandceliac disease\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        During early pregnancy, sufficientfolic acidcan help prevent thefetusfrom developing neural tube defects such asspina bifida.\r\n        \r\n          Bone marrow and stem cell problemsmay prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells. Some of thestem cellsfound in bone marrow develop into red blood cells. Ifstem cellsare too few, defective, or replaced by other cells such as metastaticcancercells, anemia may result. Anemia resulting from bone marrow or stem cell problems include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Aplastic anemiaoccurs when there's a marked reduction in the number of stem cells or absence of these cells. Aplastic anemia can be inherited, can occur without apparent cause, or can occur when the bone marrow is injured by medications,radiation,chemotherapy, or infection.\r\n          Thalassemia occurs when the red cells can't mature and grow properly. Thalassemia is an inherited condition that typically affects people of Mediterranean, African, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian descent. This condition can range in severity from mild to life-threatening; the most severe form is called Cooley's anemia.\r\n          Lead exposure is toxic to the bone marrow, leading to fewer red blood cells. Lead poisoning occurs in adults from work-related exposure and in children who eat paint chips, for example. Improperly glazed pottery can also taint food and liquids with lead.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia associated with other conditionsusually occurs when there are too few hormones necessary for red blood cell production. Conditions causing this type of anemia include the following:\r\n        \r\n          Advancedkidney disease\r\n          \r\n            Hypothyroidism\r\n          \r\n          Other chronic diseases, such ascancer, infection,lupus,diabetes, andrheumatoid arthritis\r\n          Old age\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Destruction of Red Blood Cells\r\n        When red blood cells are fragile and cannot withstand the routine stress of the circulatory system, they may rupture prematurely, causing hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia can be present at birth or develop later. Sometimes there is no known cause. Known causes of hemolytic anemia may include:\r\n        \r\n          Inherited conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia\r\n          Stressors such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods\r\n          Toxins from advancedliveror kidney disease\r\n          Inappropriate attack by the immune system (called hemolytic disease of thenewbornwhen it occurs in thefetusof a pregnant woman)\r\n          Vascular grafts,prostheticheartvalves, tumors, severe burns, exposure to certain chemicals, severehypertension, and clotting disorders\r\n          In rare cases, anenlarged spleencan trap red blood cells and destroy them before their circulating time is up.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Laura J.

{"topic": "Athlete's Foot", "content": "\r\n        What is athlete's foot?\r\n        Athlete's foot is a rash\r\n\t\t\t on the skin of the foot. It is the most common\r\n\t\t\t fungal skin infection. There are three main types of\r\n\t\t\t athlete's foot. Each type affects different parts of the foot and may look\r\n\t\t\t different. \r\n      \r\n        What causes athlete's foot?\r\n        Athlete's foot is\r\n\t\t\t caused by a\r\n\t\t\t fungus that grows on or in the top layer of skin.\r\n\t\t\t Fungi (plural of fungus) grow best in warm, wet places, such as the area\r\n\t\t\t between the toes.\r\n         Athlete's foot spreads easily. You can get it\r\n\t\t\t by touching the toes or feet of a person who has it. But most often, people get\r\n\t\t\t it by walking barefoot on contaminated surfaces near swimming pools or in\r\n\t\t\t locker rooms. The fungi then grow in your shoes, especially if your shoes are\r\n\t\t\t so tight that air cannot move around your feet.\r\n         If you touch\r\n\t\t\t something that has fungi on it, you can spread athlete's foot to other\r\n\t\t\t peopleeven if you don't get the infection yourself. Some people are more\r\n\t\t\t likely than others to get athlete's foot. Experts don't know why this is. After\r\n\t\t\t you have had athlete's foot, you are more likely to get it again.\r\n      \r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        Athlete's foot can make\r\n\t\t\t your feet and the skin between your toes burn and itch. The skin may peel and\r\n\t\t\t crack. Your symptoms can depend on the type of athlete's foot you have.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Toe web infectionToe web infection \r\n\t\t\t\tusually occurs between the fourth and fifth toes. The skin becomes scaly,\r\n\t\t\t\tpeels, and cracks. Some people also may have an infection with bacteria. This\r\n\t\t\t\tcan make the skin break down even more.\r\n          \r\n            Moccasin type infectionMoccasin type infection  may start with a little soreness on\r\n\t\t\t\tyour foot. Then the skin on the bottom or heel of your foot can become thick\r\n\t\t\t\tand crack. In bad cases, the toenails get infected and can thicken, crumble,\r\n\t\t\t\tand even fall out. Fungal infection in toenails needs separate\r\n\t\t\t\ttreatment.\r\n          \r\n            Vesicular type infectionVesicular type infection  usually\r\n\t\t\t\tbegins with a sudden outbreak of fluid-filled blisters under the skin.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe blisters are usually on the bottom of the foot. But they can appear\r\n\t\t\t\tanywhere on your foot. You also can get a bacterial infection with this type of\r\n\t\t\t\tathlete's foot.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        How is athlete's foot diagnosed?\r\n        Most of the time,\r\n\t\t\t a doctor can tell that you have athlete's foot by looking at your feet. He or\r\n\t\t\t she will also ask about your symptoms and any past fungal infections you may\r\n\t\t\t have had. If your athlete's foot looks unusual, or if treatment did not help\r\n\t\t\t you before, your doctor may take a skin or nail sample to test for\r\n\t\t\t fungi.\r\n        Not all skin problems on the foot are athlete's foot. If\r\n\t\t\t you think you have athlete's foot but have never had it before, it's a good\r\n\t\t\t idea to have your doctor look at it.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        You can treat most cases of\r\n\t\t\t athlete's foot at home with over-the-counter lotion, cream, or spray. For bad\r\n\t\t\t cases, your doctor may give you a prescription for pills or for medicine you\r\n\t\t\t put on your skin. Use the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you to.\r\n\t\t\t This will help make sure that you get rid of the infection. You also need to\r\n\t\t\t keep your feet clean and dry. Fungi need wet, warm places to grow.\r\n        You can do some things so you don't get athlete's foot again. Wear shower\r\n\t\t\t sandals in shared areas like locker rooms, and use talcum powder to help keep\r\n\t\t\t your feet dry. Wear sandals or roomy shoes made of materials that allow\r\n\t\t\t moisture to escape.\r\n      \r\n        Frequently Asked Questions\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Learning about athlete's foot:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What is athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What causes it?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How do I prevent athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the symptoms of athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What happens in athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What increases my risk for getting it?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Being diagnosed:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Who can diagnose athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is it diagnosed?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Getting treatment:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  How is athlete's foot treated?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What medicines will I need to take?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Living with athlete's foot:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do to treat athlete's foot at home?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  When should I call my doctor?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.

{"topic": "Atrial Fibrillation", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Atrial fibrillation is a problem with your heart's electrical activity. You and your doctor have treatment options if your symptoms become too severe. \r\n        With AFib, your heart quivers, beats too quickly, or skips beats. It can't pump blood through its chambers and out to your body as well as it should. Sometimes blood can pool in the heart and form clots, which could lead to a stroke.\r\n        Treatments such as medications, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery can slow your heartbeat and bring it back into a normal rhythm. AFib treatments also prevent clots and help keep your heart healthy.\r\n      \r\n        Medications\r\n        These can slow your heart rate, control your heart rhythm, and prevent clots.\r\n        \r\n          Heart-rate controlling medicines: These slow your rapid heart rate so your heart can pump more effectively. Some of these drugs include:\r\n        \r\n          Beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), bisoprolol (Zebeta), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), and timolol\r\n          Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor) and verapamil (Calan, Covera-HS, Verelan)\r\n          Digoxin (Digox, Lanoxin)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Heart-rhythm \r\n          controlling medicines: They slow the electrical signals to bring your heartbeat into a normal rhythm. These treatments are also called chemical cardioversion.\r\n        These medications include:\r\n        \r\n          Sodium channel blockers such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rythmol), and quinidine\r\n          \r\n            Potassium channel blockers such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone Pacerone), dofetilide (Tikosyn), and sotalol (Betapace, Sorine, Sotylize)\r\n        \r\n        You might get them in your doctor's office or at a hospital. Your doctor will monitor you to make sure the medicine is working.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Blood thinners: They prevent clots and include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Apixaban (Eliquis)\r\n          \r\n            Dabigatran (Pradaxa, Xarelto)\r\n          \r\n            Heparin\r\n          \r\n          warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)\r\n          \r\n            Aspirin\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Blood thinners can make you more likely to bruise or bleed too much. You'll see your doctor for a blood test every month to make sure the medication is working and you're on the right dose.\r\n      \r\n        Procedures\r\n        If medicines don't work or they cause side effects, you can try one of two procedures called cardioversion or ablation. These treat AFib without surgery.\r\n        \r\n          Cardioversion: A doctor gives you a mild electric shock to reset your heart rhythm.\r\n        First, you'll have a test called a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to see whether you have any blood clots in the top chambers of your heart, called the atria. If you do have one, you'll need to take blood thinners before the procedure.\r\n      Continued\r\n        You get cardioversion in a hospital after you have been given something that will make you sleep. Electricity travels to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. You might need to have this procedure more than once to correct your heart rhythm.\r\n        \r\n          Ablation: Your doctor burns off the tiny parts of your heart that are causing the abnormal beats. She threads a thin tube, called a catheter, through a blood vessel in your leg or groin up to your heart.\r\n        Energy travels through the tube. It burns off the areas of tissue that cause the abnormal signals. Scars form in the burned areas and block any abnormal electrical signals.\r\n        After some ablation procedures, you'll need a pacemaker to keep your heart in rhythm.\r\n      \r\n        Surgery\r\n        This might be an option if your symptoms are severe or you can't take medicine to treat AFib.\r\n        \r\n          Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion: Most strokes in people with AFib happen when blood clots form in the upper left part of their heart, the left atrium. LAA occlusion seals off this part of the heart to prevent blood clots and strokes. Your doctor can do surgery or use a catheter that she inserts into a blood vessel in your leg.Maze procedure: During this type of surgery, the doctor makes very small cuts in the top part of your heart. After she sews up the cuts, scar tissue forms.\r\n        This scar tissue prevents the abnormal signals that cause AFib. Some people will need a pacemaker after maze surgery.\r\n      \r\n        Treating the Causes of AFib\r\n        If problems such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, or an overactive thyroid caused your AFib, you'll need to treat the underlying cause. Your doctor might prescribe medications to get those conditions under control.\r\n        Your doctor may also recommend screening and treatment for sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night.\r\n        You might also need to make these changes to your daily life to keep your heart healthy:\r\n        \r\n          Limit sugar, salt, and fat in your diet\r\n          \r\n            Quit smoking\r\n          \r\n          Cut down on alcohol and caffeine\r\n          \r\n            Exercise and eat healthier to control your weight\r\n          Avoid certain cough and cold medicines that contain stimulants, which make your heart beat faster\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by James  Beckerman, MD, FACC on October 09, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: \"Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.\"\r\n            American Heart Association: \"Atrial Fibrillation Medications,\" \"Non-surgical Procedures for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF),\" \"Surgical Procedures for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF),\" \"What is Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF)?\"\r\n            Cleveland Clinic: \"Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\"\r\n            National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: \"How Is Atrial Fibrillation Treated?\" \"What is Cardioversion?\"\r\n            The Society of Thoracic Surgeons: \"Atrial Fibrillation Surgery -- Maze Procedure.\"\r\n            UAB Medicine: \"Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion.\"\r\n            Mayo Clinic: Sleep Apnea.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Amputation Overview", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Amputation is the surgical removal of all or part of a limb or extremity such as an arm, leg, foot, hand, toe, or finger.\r\n        About 1.8 million Americans are living with amputations. Amputation of the leg -- either above or below the knee -- is the most common amputation surgery.\r\n      \r\n        Reasons for Amputation\r\n        There are many reasons an amputation may be necessary. The most common is poor circulation because of damage or narrowing of the arteries, called peripheral arterial disease. Without adequate blood flow, the body's cells cannot get oxygen and nutrients they need from the bloodstream. As a result, the affected tissue begins to die and infection may set in.\r\n        Other causes for amputation may include:\r\n        \r\n          Severe injury (from a vehicle accident or serious burn, for example)\r\n          Cancerous tumor in the bone or muscle of the limb\r\n          Serious infection that does not get better with antibiotics or other treatment\r\n          Thickening of nerve tissue, called a neuroma\r\n          \r\n            Frostbite\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        The Amputation Procedure\r\n        An amputation usually requires a hospital stay of five to 14 days or more, depending on the surgery and complications. The procedure itself may vary, depending on the limb or extremity being amputated and the patient's general health.\r\n        Amputation may be done under general anesthesia (meaning the patient is asleep) or with spinal anesthesia, which numbs the body from the waist down.\r\n        When performing an amputation, the surgeon removes all damaged tissue while leaving as much healthy tissue as possible.\r\n        A doctor may use several methods to determine where to cut and how much tissue to remove. These include:\r\n        \r\n          Checking for a pulse close to where the surgeon is planning to cut\r\n          Comparing skin temperatures of the affected limb with those of a healthy limb\r\n          Looking for areas of reddened skin\r\n          Checking to see if the skin near the site where the surgeon is planning to cut is still sensitive to touch\r\n        \r\n        During the procedure itself, the surgeon will:\r\n        \r\n          Remove the diseased tissue and any crushed bone\r\n          Smooth uneven areas of bone\r\n          Seal off blood vessels and nerves\r\n          Cut and shape muscles so that the stump, or end of the limb, will be able to have an artificial limb (prosthesis) attached to it\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        The surgeon may choose to close the wound right away by sewing the skin flaps (called a closed amputation). Or the surgeon may leave the site open for several days in case there's a need to remove additional tissue.\r\n        The surgical team then places a sterile dressing on the wound and may place a stocking over the stump to hold drainage tubes or bandages. The doctor may place the limb in traction, in which a device holds it in position, or may use a splint.\r\n      \r\n        Recovery From Amputation\r\n        Recovery from amputation depends on the type of procedure and anesthesia used.\r\n        In the hospital, the staff changes the dressings on the wound or teaches the patient to change them. The doctor monitors wound healing and any conditions that might interfere with healing, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. The doctor prescribes medications to ease pain and help prevent infection.\r\n        If the patient has problems with phantom pain (a sense of pain in the amputated limb) or grief over the lost limb, the doctor will prescribe medication and/or counseling, as necessary.\r\n        \r\n          Physical therapy, beginning with gentle, stretching exercises, often begins soon after surgery. Practice with the artificial limb may begin as soon as 10 to 14 days after surgery.\r\n        Ideally, the wound should fully heal in about four to eight weeks. But the physical and emotional adjustment to losing a limb can be a long process. Long-term recovery and rehabilitation will include:\r\n        \r\n          Exercises to improve muscle strength and control\r\n          Activities to help restore the ability to carry out daily activities and promote independence\r\n          Use of artificial limbs and assistive devices\r\n          Emotional support, including counseling, to help with grief over the loss of the limb and adjustment to the new body image\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Carol  DerSarkissian on February 25, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            UAB Medicine: \"Amputation.\"\r\n            University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences: \"Amputation Procedure.\"\r\n            VascularWeb: \"Amputation.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Angina", "content": "\r\n        If you feel pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign.\r\n        The chest pain happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's occurs when something blocks the arteries or there's a decreased blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\r\n        \r\n          Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have it. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack.\r\n        There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control it. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need whats called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.\r\n        There are different types of angina:\r\n        \r\n          Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\r\n        \r\n          Unstable angina. You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.\r\n        \r\n          Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.\r\n      \r\n        Causes\r\n        Angina is usually due to heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.\r\n        Other, less common causes of chest pain include:\r\n        \r\n          A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\r\n          An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)\r\n          Narrowing of a valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)\r\n          Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)\r\n          Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms\r\n        Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:\r\n        \r\n          Aching\r\n          Burning\r\n          Discomfort\r\n          Feeling of fullness in the chest\r\n          Heaviness\r\n          Pressure\r\n          Squeezing\r\n        \r\n        Youre likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.\r\n        It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.\r\n        Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.\r\n        One study found that women were more likely to use the words \"pressing\" or \"crushing\" to describe the feeling.\r\n        Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse.\r\n      \r\n        Questions for Your Doctor\r\n        \r\n          Do I need any more tests?\r\n          What type of angina do I have?\r\n          Do I have heart damage?\r\n          What treatment do you recommend?\r\n          How will it make me feel?\r\n          What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack?\r\n          Are there activities I shouldn't do?\r\n          Will changing my diet help?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Treatment\r\n        It depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help blood flow better and control symptoms.\r\n        Your doctor might prescribe medicines to:\r\n        \r\n          Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart\r\n          Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard\r\n          Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart\r\n          Prevent blood clots\r\n        \r\n        If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:\r\n        \r\n          Angioplasty\r\n          /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again.\r\n      Continued\r\n        The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. Youll probably stay overnight at the hospital.\r\n        \r\n          Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. The surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.\r\n        You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover.\r\n      \r\n        Taking Care of Yourself\r\n        You can still lead an active life, but it's important that you listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what youre doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often.\r\n        These lifestyle changes can help protect your heart:\r\n        \r\n          Stop smoking\r\n          . It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.\r\n        \r\n          Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar.\r\n        Also:\r\n        \r\n          Use stress-relieving measures like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax.\r\n          \r\n            Exercise most days of the week.\r\n          See your doctor regularly.\r\n        \r\n        If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Don't wait. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage.\r\n      \r\n        What to Expect\r\n        Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But its treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make smart choices.\r\n        Talk with others who have it. That may help you learn how to feel better.\r\n        Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina. They'll want to know what they can do to help.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Laura J.

{"topic": "Amyloidosis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Amyloidosis is a condition in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.\r\n      \r\n        Causes and Types of Amyloidosis\r\n        Many different proteins can lead to the formation of amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to significant health problems. The type of protein and where it collects determines the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area.\r\n        There are different types of amyloidosis, including:\r\n        \r\n          Primary (systemic AL) amyloidosis. This occurs without a known cause, but it has been seen in people with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. This is the most common type of amyloidosis. \"Systemic\" means it affects the entire body. The most commonly affected body parts are the kidney, heart, liver, intestines, and certain nerves. AL stands for \"amyloid light chains,\" which is the type of protein responsible for this type of amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          Secondary (systemic AA) amyloidosis. This is the result of another chronic inflammatory disease, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and certain cancers. It most commonly affects the spleen, kidneys, liver, adrenal gland, and lymph nodes. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type of amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can occur in many different tissues, but most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons.\r\n        \r\n          Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis (AF). This is a rare form that is passed down through families. It is caused by an abnormal amyloid transthyretin (TTR) protein, which is made in the liver. This protein is responsible for the most common forms of hereditary amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). This is caused deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It occurs most commonly in older men.\r\n        \r\n          Organ-specific amyloidosis. This is cause deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis).\r\n        While some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely involved in systemic amyloidosis.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Risk Factors for Amyloidosis\r\n        Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis increases as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma.\r\n        Amyloidosis may also occur in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see \"Dialysis-related amyloidosis\" above). \r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Amyloidosis\r\n        Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of different health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis.\r\n        General symptoms of amyloidosis may include:\r\n        \r\n          Changes in skin color\r\n          Clay-colored stools\r\n          \r\n            Fatigue\r\n          \r\n          Feeling of fullness\r\n          \r\n            Joint pain\r\n          \r\n          Low red blood cell count (anemia)\r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n          Swelling of the tongue\r\n          Tingling and numbness in legs and feet\r\n          Weak hand grip\r\n          \r\n            Weakness\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Weight loss\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Cardiac (Heart) Amyloidosis\r\n        Amyloid deposits in the heart can make the walls of the heart muscle stiff. They can also make the heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump. If amyloidosis affects your heart, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Shortness of breath with light activity\r\n          An irregular heartbeat\r\n          \r\n            Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis\r\n        Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes.\r\n          High levels of protein in your urine.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis\r\n        Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the muscle contractions that help move food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Decreased appetite\r\n          \r\n            Diarrhea\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Nausea\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Stomach pain\r\n          \r\n          Weight loss\r\n        \r\n        Liver involvement can cause liver enlargement, fluid buildup in the body, and abnormal liver function tests.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Amyloid Neuropathy\r\n        Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Balance problems\r\n          Problems controlling your bladder and bowel\r\n          \r\n            Sweating problems\r\n          Tingling and weakness\r\n          Light-headedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure\r\n        \r\n        Amyloidosis can also involve other organs including the lungs, skin, and spleen.\r\n      \r\n        Diagnosing Amyloidosis\r\n        A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis.\r\n        There is no blood test to detect amyloidosis. Sophisticated laboratory techniques called electrophoresis or free light chain assays may reveal early evidence of some amyloid proteins. \r\n        A biopsy is needed to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and determine the specific type of protein involved in the disease. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from the abdominal fat pad, or sometimes the mouth, rectal, or other involved organs. It is not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits.\r\n        Genetic testing will be done if your health care provider suspects you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different than for other types of the disease.\r\n        Other blood, urine, and imaging tests will be done to check organ function.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Amyloidosis Treatment\r\n        There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to suppress the development of the amyloid-forming protein, and to manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition.\r\n        Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected.\r\n        \r\n          High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in those with primary AL amyloidosis who have no more than two major organs damaged. Chemotherapy medicines alone are used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis.\r\n          Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation.\r\n          \r\n            Liver transplant may stop the disease in those with hereditary amyloidosis.\r\n          A kidney or heart transplant may also be recommended.\r\n        \r\n        Other treatments to help with symptoms may involve:\r\n        \r\n          Diuretic medicine to remove excess water from your body\r\n          Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking in those who have swelling of the tongue \r\n          \r\n            Compression stockings to relieve swelling in the legs or feet\r\n           Diet modifications, especially for those with gastrointestinal amyloidosis\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What to Expect\r\n        Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment is important and can help improve survival. Without treatment, many patients die within two years of diagnosis.\r\n        Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to investigate new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can participate in, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term \"amyloidosis.\"\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David T.

{"topic": "Alzheimer's Symptoms", "content": "\r\n        The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease often come on slowly. It might start when someone has trouble recalling things that just happened or putting thoughts into words. But over time, the problems get worse. People in the later stages of the disease usually cant live alone or care for themselves.\r\n        There are three main phases of Alzheimer's: mild, moderate, and severe. Each stage has its own set of symptoms.\r\n      \r\n        Mild Alzheimer's\r\n        The first stage usually lasts from 2 to 4 years. The symptoms include:\r\n        \r\n          Having less energy and drive to do things\r\n          Less interest in work and social activities and spending more time just sitting, watching TV, or sleeping\r\n          Loss of recent memories, like forgetting conversations and events that just happened\r\n          Language problems, like trouble putting their thoughts into words or understanding others\r\n          Mild coordination problems, such as trouble writing or using familiar objects.\r\n          A hard time with everyday tasks, such as following a recipe or balancing a checkbook\r\n          Mood swings that involve depression or a lack of interest\r\n          Trouble with driving, like getting lost on familiar routes\r\n        \r\n        When a person has one or a few of these issues, it doesnt necessarily mean he has Alzheimer's. There are other medical conditions that can cause the same problems, such as:\r\n        \r\n          Conditions that affect metabolism, such as a thyroid problem\r\n          \r\n            Drug abuse\r\n          \r\n          Taking medications that dont work well together\r\n          \r\n            Parkinson's disease\r\n          \r\n          Stress\r\n          \r\n            Depression\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        A doctor can check on these symptoms and do tests to know if a person has Alzheimers or something else.\r\n      \r\n        Moderate Alzheimer's\r\n        This is when memory loss gets worse and starts to cause problems in daily life. This stage can last from 2 to 10 years.\r\n        Someone with moderate Alzheimer's may start to forget details about his life, like where he went to high school or when he got married. He may not recognize or remember family members and friends. He might also forget where he leaves things and cant retrace his steps to find them.\r\n        Other symptoms at this stage can include:\r\n        \r\n          Rambling speech\r\n          Trouble coming up with the right words and using the wrong ones\r\n          A hard time planning or solving problems\r\n          Confusion about time or place. He may get lost in places hes been before. Once hes there, he may not know how or why he got to that place.\r\n          Not dressing for the weather\r\n          Getting angry or upset easily, sometimes lashing out at family or caregivers\r\n          \r\n            Trouble sleeping\r\n          \r\n          Wandering\r\n          Delusions, such as thinking a caregiver is trying to hurt him\r\n        \r\n        Some people with moderate Alzheimers also become more aware that theyre losing control of their lives, which can make them even more frustrated or depressed.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Severe Alzheimer's\r\n        The third stage, also known as late Alzheimer's, is the most severe. It typically lasts 1 to 3 years.\r\n        People in this phase might have some or all of these symptoms:\r\n        \r\n          Major confusion about whats in the past and whats happening now\r\n          Cant express themselves, remember, or process information\r\n          Problems with swallowing and control of their bladder and bowels\r\n          \r\n            Weight loss, seizures, skin infections, and other illnesses\r\n          Extreme mood swings\r\n          Seeing, hearing, or feeling things that arent really there, called hallucinations\r\n          Cant move easily on their own\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Alzheimer's or Normal Aging?\r\n        Just about everyone has minor memory glitches as they get older. If someone forgets a name or why he walked into the kitchen, that doesn't mean he has Alzheimer's.\r\n        The main problem that defines the disease is trouble planning and handling day-to-day tasks, like paying bills, managing a checkbook, or using familiar appliances around the house.\r\n      \r\n        What You Can Do\r\n        If you think you notice the signs of Alzheimers in yourself or a loved one, the best thing to do is to talk to a doctor. He can let you know what the symptoms mean and what your options are for treating them.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Richard  Senelick, MD on February 28, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Alzheimer's Association: \"10 Early signs & Symptoms of Alzheimer's\" and \"Principles for a Dignified Diagnosis.\"\r\n            Helpguide.org: \"Alzheimer's Disease.\"\r\n            Alzheimer's Disease Research: \"Alzheimer's Symptoms & Stages.\r\n            National Institute on Aging: \"About Alzheimer's Disease: Symptoms.\"\r\n            Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation: \"Top Ten Alzheimer's Signs and Symptoms.\"\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Acoustic Neuroma", "content": "\r\n        An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve. Also known as the vestibulocochlear nerve, it connects the inner ear with the brain and has two different parts. One part is involved in transmitting sound; the other helps send balance information from the inner ear to the brain.\r\n        Acoustic neuromas -- sometimes called vestibular schwannomas or neurolemmomas -- usually grow slowly over a period of years. Although they do not actually invade the brain, they can push on it as they grow. Larger tumors can press on nearby cranial nerves that control the muscles of facial expression and sensation. If tumors become large enough to press on the brain stem or cerebellum, they can be deadly.\r\n      \r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Symptoms\r\n        The early symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often subtle. Many people attribute the symptoms to normal changes of aging, so it may be a while before the condition is diagnosed.\r\n        The first symptom is usually a gradual loss of hearing in one ear, often accompanied by ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or a feeling of fullness in the ear. Less commonly, acoustic neuromas may cause sudden hearing loss.\r\n        Other symptoms, which may occur over time, include:\r\n        \r\n          Problems with balance\r\n          \r\n            Vertigo (feeling like the world is spinning)\r\n          Facial numbness and tingling, which may be constant or come and go\r\n          Facial weakness\r\n          Taste changes\r\n          Difficulty swallowing and hoarseness\r\n          \r\n            Headaches\r\n          \r\n          Clumsiness or unsteadiness\r\n          Confusion\r\n        \r\n        It's important to see your doctor if you experience these symptoms. Symptoms like clumsiness and mental confusion can signal a serious problem that requires urgent treatment.\r\n      \r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Causes\r\n        There are two types of acoustic neuroma: a sporadic form and a form associated with a syndrome called neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). NF2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system. Acoustic neuromas are the most common of these tumors and often occur in both ears by age 30.\r\n        NF2 is a rare disorder. It accounts for only 5% of acoustic neuromas. This means the vast majority are the sporadic form. Doctors aren't certain what causes the sporadic form. One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation, especially to the head and neck.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Treatments\r\n        There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma:\r\n        \r\n          Observation\r\n          Surgery\r\n          Radiation therapy\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Observation is also called watchful waiting. Because acoustic neuromas are not cancerous and grow slowly, immediate treatment may not be necessary. Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms.\r\n        \r\n          Surgery for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor.\r\n        There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:\r\n        \r\n          Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear. This procedure is used for tumors larger than 3 centimeters. The upside of this approach is that it allows the surgeon to see an important cranial nerve (the facial nerve) clearly before removing the tumor. The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss.\r\n          Retrosigmoid/sub-occipital, which involves exposing the back of the tumor by opening the skull near the back of the head. This approach can be used for removing tumors of any size and offers the possibility of preserving hearing.\r\n          Middle fossa, which involves removing a small piece of bone above the ear canal to access and remove small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal, the narrow passageway from the brain to the middle and inner ear. Using this approach may enable surgeons to preserve a patient's hearing.\r\n        \r\n        A newer, less invasive technique called total endoscopic resection enables surgeons to remove acoustic neuromas using a small camera inserted through a hole in the skull. This technique is offered only at major medical centers with specially trained surgeons. Initial studies show success rates similar to those with conventional surgery.\r\n        \r\n          Radiation therapy is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas. State-of-the-art delivery techniques make it possible to send high doses of radiation to the tumor while limiting expose and damage to surrounding tissue.\r\n        Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways:\r\n        \r\n          Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in which many hundreds of small beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor in a single session.\r\n          Multi-session fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FRS), which delivers smaller doses of radiation daily, generally over several weeks. Early studies suggest multi-session therapy may preserve hearing better than SRS.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Both of these are outpatient procedures, which means they don't require a hospital stay. They work by causing tumor cells to die. The tumor's growth may slow or stop or it may even shrink, but radiation doesn't completely remove the tumor.\r\n        Other types of radiation therapy have also been used. Your doctor will explain your options to you.\r\n        Selecting the right treatment depends on a number of factors, including:\r\n        \r\n          Size of the tumor\r\n          Whether the tumor is growing\r\n          Your age\r\n          Other medical conditions you may have\r\n          Severity of your symptoms and their impact on your life\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Lisa  Bernstein, MD on July 13, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES: UCLA Health System: \"Acoustic Neuroma Brain Tumor.\" Acoustic Neuroma Foundation: \"What Is Acoustic Neuroma?\" Acoustic Neuroma Association: \"Symptoms of Acoustic Neuroma.\" American Hearing Research Foundation: \"Acoustic Neuroma.\" Genetics Home Reference: \"Neurofibromatosis type 2.\"Acoustic Neuroma Association: \"Treatment Options.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Acute Renal Failure ", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Is this topic for you?\r\n        This topic provides\r\n\t\t\t information about sudden kidney injury. If you are looking for information\r\n\t\t\t about long-term kidney disease, see the topic\r\n\t\t\t Chronic Kidney Disease.\r\n      \r\n        What is acute kidney injury?\r\n        Acute kidney injury\r\n\t\t\t (which used to be called acute renal failure) means that your\r\n\t\t\t kidneys  have suddenly stopped working normally. Your kidneys\r\n\t\t\t remove waste products and help balance water and salt and other minerals (electrolytes) in your blood. When your kidneys stop\r\n\t\t\t working, waste products, fluids, and electrolytes build up in your body. This\r\n\t\t\t can cause problems that can be deadly.\r\n      \r\n        What causes acute kidney injury?\r\n        Acute kidney injury has three main causes:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            A sudden, serious drop in blood flow to the kidneys. Heavy blood loss, an injury, or a bad\r\n\t\t\t\tinfection called\r\n\t\t\t\tsepsis can reduce blood flow to the kidneys. Not\r\n\t\t\t\tenough fluid in the body (dehydration) also can harm the\r\n\t\t\t\tkidneys.\r\n          \r\n            Damage from some medicines, poisons, or infections. Most people don't have any kidney problems from taking\r\n\t\t\t\tmedicines. But people who have serious, long-term health problems are more likely\r\n\t\t\t\tthan other people to have a kidney problem from medicines. Examples of medicines that\r\n\t\t\t\tcan sometimes harm the kidneys include: \r\n\t\t\t\tAntibiotics, such as gentamicin and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t streptomycin.Pain medicines, such as naproxen and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t ibuprofen.Some blood pressure medicines, such as ACE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t inhibitors.The dyes used in some X-ray tests.\r\n          \r\n            A sudden blockage that stops urine from flowing out of the kidneys. Kidney stones, a tumor, an\r\n\t\t\t\tinjury, or an enlarged prostate gland can cause a blockage.\r\n        \r\n        You have a greater chance of getting acute kidney injury\r\n\t\t\t if:\r\n        \r\n          You are an older adult.\r\n          You have\r\n\t\t\t\ta long-term health problem such as kidney or liver disease,\r\n\t\t\t\tdiabetes,\r\n\t\t\t\thigh blood pressure,\r\n\t\t\t\theart failure, or\r\n\t\t\t\tobesity.\r\n          You are already very ill and are\r\n\t\t\t\tin the hospital or intensive care (ICU). Heart or belly surgery or a\r\n\t\t\t\tbone marrow transplant can make you more likely to\r\n\t\t\t\thave kidney problems.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n         Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include:\r\n        \r\n          Little or no urine when you\r\n\t\t\t\ttry to urinate.\r\n          Swelling, especially in your legs and feet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n          Not feeling like eating.\r\n          Nausea and\r\n\t\t\t\tvomiting.\r\n          Feeling confused, anxious and restless, or\r\n\t\t\t\tsleepy.\r\n          Pain in the back just below the rib cage. This is called\r\n\t\t\t\tflank pain.\r\n        \r\n         Some people may not have any symptoms. And for people who are already quite ill, the problem that's causing the kidney injury may be causing other symptoms. \r\n      Continued\r\n        How is acute kidney injury diagnosed?\r\n        Acute kidney injury is most often diagnosed during a hospital stay for another cause. If you are already in the hospital, tests done for other problems\r\n\t\t  may find your kidney problem. \r\n        If you're not in the hospital but have symptoms of kidney injury, your doctor\r\n\t\t\t will ask about your symptoms, what medicines you take, and what tests\r\n\t\t\t you have had. Your symptoms can help point to the cause of your kidney\r\n\t\t\t problem.\r\n        Blood and urine tests can check how well your kidneys are\r\n\t\t\t working. A chemistry screen can show if you have normal levels of\r\n\t\t\t sodium (salt),\r\n\t\t\t potassium, and\r\n\t\t\t calcium. You may also have an\r\n\t\t\t ultrasound. This imaging test lets your doctor see\r\n\t\t\t a picture of your kidneys.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        Your doctor or a kidney\r\n\t\t\t specialist (nephrologist) will try to treat the problem that is causing your\r\n\t\t\t kidney injury. Treatment can vary widely, depending on the cause. For example, your doctor may need to restore blood flow to the kidneys, stop any medicines that may be causing the problem, or remove or bypass a blockage in the urinary tract. \r\n        At the same time, the doctor will try to:\r\n        \r\n          Stop wastes from building up in your body.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou may have\r\n\t\t\t\tdialysis. This treatment uses a machine to do the work\r\n\t\t\t\tof your kidneys until they recover. It will help you feel\r\n\t\t\t\tbetter.\r\n          Prevent other problems. You may take antibiotics to prevent\r\n\t\t\t\tor treat infections. You also may take other medicines to get rid of extra\r\n\t\t\t\tfluid and keep your body's minerals in balance.\r\n        \r\n        You can help yourself heal by taking your medicines as\r\n\t\t\t your doctor tells you to. You also may need to follow a special diet to keep\r\n\t\t\t your kidneys from working too hard. You may need to limit sodium, potassium,\r\n\t\t\t and\r\n\t\t\t phosphorus. A dietitian can help you plan\r\n\t\t\t meals.\r\n      \r\n        Does acute kidney injury cause lasting problems?\r\n        Doctors sometimes  can fix the problems that cause kidney\r\n\t\t\t injury. The treatment takes a few days or weeks. These people's kidneys will work well enough\r\n\t\t\t for them to live normal lives.\r\n        But other people may have permanent\r\n\t\t\t kidney damage that leads to\r\n\t\t\t chronic kidney disease. A small number of them\r\n\t\t  will need to have regular\r\n\t\t  dialysis or a\r\n\t\t  kidney transplant. Older people and those who are\r\n\t\t\t very sick from other health problems may not get better. People who die usually\r\n\t\t\t do so because of the health problem that caused their kidneys to fail. \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.

{"topic": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. AML usually develops from cells that would turn into white blood cells (other than lymphocytes). Sometimes, though, it can develop from other types of blood-forming cells. Here is basic information about the symptoms, risk factors, survival rates, and treatments for AML.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?\r\n        Acute myeloid leukemia starts in the bone marrow. This is the soft inner parts of bones. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells don't mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, often called blast cells, just keep building up.\r\n        You may hear other names for acute myeloid leukemia. Doctors may call it:\r\n        \r\n          Acute myelocytic leukemia\r\n          Acute myelogenous leukemia\r\n          Acute granulocytic leukemia\r\n          Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia\r\n        \r\n        Without treatment, AML can quickly be fatal. Because it's \"acute,\" this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body such as the following organs:\r\n        \r\n          Lymph nodes\r\n          \r\n            Liver\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Spleen\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Brain and spinal cord\r\n          Testicles\r\n        \r\n        The expected outcome for acute myeloid leukemia depends on certain factors. And of course, prognosis is better if your leukemia responds well to treatment. Your outlook is better if:\r\n        \r\n          You are younger than age 60\r\n          You do not have a history of blood disorders or cancers\r\n          You do not have certain gene mutations or chromosome changes\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Risk Factors for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        If something increases your risk of getting a disease, it's called a risk factor. Risk factors don't tell the whole story. For example, you can have few risk factors and still get a disease or have several and not get it.\r\n        Acute myeloid leukemia risk factors include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Smoking\r\n          \r\n          Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene (a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke), certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers\r\n          Treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers, such as mechlorethamine, procarbazine, and chlorambucil -- especially when combined with radiation therapy\r\n          Exposure to high doses of radiation\r\n          Certain blood disorders, such as myeloproliferative disorders (for example, chronic myelogenous leukemia)\r\n          Certain congenital syndromes, such as Down syndrome\r\n          Being male\r\n        \r\n        For most people, the cause of AML is unknown. There is not a way to prevent it, but you may reduce your risk by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to chemicals.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        If you have any of the symptoms mentioned below, it's important to have a doctor check them out right away to determine the cause.\r\n        AML can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. Since the symptoms are often vague, they could be caused by other conditions. Symptoms include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fatigue\r\n          \r\n          Fever\r\n          Loss of appetite or weight\r\n          \r\n            Night sweats\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        Many symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia are the result of a shortage of normal blood cells. That's because leukemia cells crowd out normal cells in the bone marrow.\r\n        \r\n          A shortage of red blood cells may cause symptoms of anemia including:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fatigue or weakness\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness\r\n          \r\n          Feeling cold\r\n          Light-headedness\r\n          \r\n            Headaches\r\n          \r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          A shortage of normal white blood cells may result in:\r\n        \r\n          Recurring infections\r\n          \r\n            Fevers\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          A shortage of blood platelets may cause symptoms such as:\r\n        \r\n          Lots of bruising for no clear reason\r\n          Frequent or severe nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or other unusual bleeding, such as from minor cuts\r\n        \r\n        Depending upon where leukemia cells are present, other symptoms may include:\r\n        \r\n          Bone or joint pain\r\n          A full or swollen belly from leukemia cells in the liver or spleen\r\n          Lumps or rashes in the skin\r\n          Swollen, painful, bleeding gums\r\n          \r\n            Headache, trouble with balance, vomiting, seizures, or blurred vision\r\n          \r\n            Enlarged lymph nodes such as in the neck or groin, under arms, or above the collarbone (rare)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Treatment for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        Because AML is a group of related diseases, treatment depends upon each subtype as well as on other factors. It is important to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis.\r\n        You may have more than one type of treatment, including:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs -- often two or three -- such as cytarabine, anthracycline drugs, 6-thioguanine, hydroxyurea, or prednisone\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for AML, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain, bone, or testicles; before a stem cell transplant; or, in rare cases, to shrink a tumor that's pressing on the windpipe.\r\n          \r\n            A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation, followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells; Stem cells usually come from a donor, or, less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a \"mini-transplant.\"\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia? The five-year survival rate overall is about 24%. Surviving at least five years indicates a good chance of long-term survival. Survival rates may be better now as this statistic reflects outcomes from 1999 to 2006.\r\n        AML treatment consists of two parts: induction therapy and consolidation therapy, which are both done in the hospital.\r\n        The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by:\r\n        \r\n          Killing as many AML cells as possible\r\n          Returning blood counts to normal over time\r\n          Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time\r\n        \r\n        Even if remission is achieved, you will likely still need more treatment. Consolidation therapy attacks leukemia cells that common blood or marrow tests can't find. This therapy may include chemotherapy, which may be different drugs than those used earlier, and possibly a bone marrow transplant.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Sujana  Movva, MD on April 26, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES: American Cancer Society: \"What is acute myeloid leukemia?\"\"How is acute myeloid leukemia classified?\"\"What are the risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia?\" \"How is acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed?\"and \"Treating Leukemia -- Acute Myeloid (AML) Topics.\"\r\n            Leukemia & Lymphoma Society: \"Leukemia Facts & Statistics\"and \"Acute Myeloid Lymphoma.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. Also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia, it is the least common type of leukemia in adults. Here's what you need to know about symptoms, prognosis, survival rates, and treatment for ALL.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia?\r\n        ALL is a type of leukemia that starts from white blood cells in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones. It develops from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell central to the immune system, or from lymphoblasts, an immature type of lymphocyte.\r\n        Acute lymphoblastic leukemia invades the blood and can spread throughout the body to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. But it does not normally produce tumors as do many types of cancer. It is an acute type of leukemia, which means it can progress quickly. Without treatment, it can be fatal within a few months.\r\n        The outlook for acute lymphoblastic leukemia depends on factors such as:\r\n        \r\n          Your age: Younger patients tend to have a better outlook.\r\n          Your lab test results: The prognosis is better if you have a lower white blood count when you're diagnosed.\r\n          Your subtype of ALL (B-cell ALL or T-cell ALL)\r\n          Whether you have a chromosome abnormality called the Philadelphia chromosome; having it suggests a poorer prognosis.\r\n          Your response to chemotherapy: The prognosis is better if you have no evidence of leukemia four to five weeks after starting treatment.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Risk Factors for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n        For most people, the cause of ALL is unknown. For this reason, there is no known way to prevent it. However, there are a few known risk factors for this type of leukemia. This means these factors may increase your chances of getting acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But it is not yet known whether these risk factors are actual causes of the disease:\r\n        \r\n          Exposure to high levels of radiation to treat other types of cancer\r\n          Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene, a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke, certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers\r\n          Infection with human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) in rarer cases outside the U.S., or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a related leukemia more commonly seen in Africa\r\n          Having an inherited genetic syndrome such as Down syndrome\r\n          Being white\r\n          Being male\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n      \r\n        Treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n        ALL is really a group of related diseases, or subtypes. Therefore, your treatment options depend upon your subtype and other factors. You may have more than one type of treatment. These include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs in combination, generally over a couple of years. Agents used for ALL include: vincristine (Oncovin),cytarabine (Cytosar)daunorubicin (Cerubidine) or doxorubicin (Adriamycin)L-asparaginace (Elspar) or PEG-L-asapraginase (Oncaspar)etoposide (VP-16)teniposide (Vumon)6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, Purinethol)methotrexatecyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Targeted therapy, drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells and tend to have fewer or less severe side effects than chemotherapy; examples include imatinib (Gleevec), dasatinib (Sprycel), blinatumomab (Blincyto), ponatinib (Iclusig), and nilotinib (Tasigna), which attack cells with the Philadelphia chromosome.\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for ALL, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain or bone, for example, or before a stem cell transplant.\r\n          \r\n            A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells; stem cells usually come from a donor, or less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a \"mini-transplant.\"\r\n        \r\n        Treatment occurs in two parts -- induction therapy and post-induction therapy.\r\n        The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by:\r\n        \r\n          Killing as many leukemia cells as possible\r\n          Returning blood counts to normal\r\n          Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time\r\n        \r\n        About eight or nine out of 10 adults achieve remission after treatments, but many relapse, which lowers the overall cure rate to 30% to 40%. So even with remission, post-induction therapy is needed to prevent relapse. It involves cycles of treatment over two to three years. Usually, the drugs are different than the drugs used in induction therapy. The goal is to completely rid the body of leukemia cells that have not been found by common blood or marrow tests.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Sujana  Movva, MD on April 26, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            American Cancer Society: \"What is acute lymphocytic leukemia?\"\"How is acute lymphocytic leukemia classified?\"\"What are the risk factors for acute lymphocytic leukemia?\"\"How is acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed?\"\"Treating Leukemia -- Acute Lymphocytic (ALL) in Adults;\"and \"Response rates to treatment.\"\r\n            The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society: \"Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\"and \"Leukemia Facts & Statistics.\"\r\n            ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "ACL Injuries", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury?\r\n        An anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, injury is a tear in one of the knee ligaments that joins the upper leg bone with the lower leg bone . The ACL keeps the knee stable. \r\n        Injuries range from mild, such as a small tear, to severe, such as when the ligament tears completely or when the ligament and part of the bone separate from the rest of the bone.\r\n         Without treatment, the injured ACL is less able to control knee movement, and the bones are more likely to rub against each other. This is called chronic ACL deficiency. The abnormal bone movement can also damage the tissue (cartilage ) that covers the ends of the bones and can trap and tear the pads (menisci ) that cushion the knee joints. This damage can lead to osteoarthritis.\r\n         Sometimes other knee ligaments or parts of the knee are also injured. This includes cartilage such as the menisci, or bones in the knee joint, which can be broken. \r\n      \r\n        What causes an ACL injury?\r\n        Your ACL can be injured if your knee joint is bent backward, twisted, or bent side to side. The chance of injury is higher if more than one of these movements occurs at the same time. Contact (being hit by another person or object) also can cause an ACL injury.\r\n        An ACL injury often occurs during sports. The injury can happen when your foot is firmly planted on the ground and a sudden force hits your knee while your leg is straight or slightly bent. This can happen when you are changing direction rapidly, slowing down when running, or landing from a jump. This type of injury is common in soccer, skiing, football, and other sports with lots of stop-and-go movements, jumping, or weaving. Falling off a ladder or missing a step on a staircase are other likely causes. Like any other body part, the ACL becomes weaker with age. So a tear happens more easily in people older than age 40.\r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        Symptoms of an acute ACL injury include:\r\n        \r\n          Feeling or hearing a pop in the knee at the time of injury.\r\n           Pain on the outside and back of the knee.\r\n           The knee swelling within the first few hours of the injury. This may be a sign of bleeding inside the knee joint. Swelling that occurs suddenly is usually a sign of a serious knee injury.\r\n           Limited knee movement because of pain or swelling or both.\r\n           The knee feeling unstable, buckling, or giving out.\r\n        \r\n        After an acute injury, you will probably have to stop whatever you are doing because of the pain, but you may be able to walk.\r\n         The main symptom of chronic ACL deficiency is the knee buckling or giving out, sometimes with pain and swelling. This can happen when an ACL injury is not treated. \r\n      \r\n        How is an ACL injury diagnosed?\r\n        Your doctor can tell whether you have an ACL injury by asking questions about your past health and examining your knee. The doctor may ask: How did you injure your knee? Have you had any other knee injuries? Your doctor will check for stability, movement, and tenderness in both the injured and uninjured knee.\r\n         You may need X-rays, which can show damage to the knee bones. Or you may need other imaging tests, such as an MRI. An MRI can show damage to ligaments, tendons, muscles, and knee cartilage. Arthroscopy may also be done. During arthroscopy, your doctor inserts surgical tools through one or more small cuts (incisions) in the knee to look at the inside of the knee.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        Start first aid right away. These first-aid tips will reduce swelling and pain. Use the RICE method. The letters stand for Rest the knee, put Ice on it, use an elastic bandage to give gentle Compression to the knee, and Elevate the leg by propping it up above the level of your heart. And at first it's also important to move your leg as little as possible. Take over-the-counter pain medicine.\r\n      Continued\r\n         You may need to walk with crutches and use a knee immobilizer to keep your knee still for the first few days after the injury.\r\n         Your knee will need to be checked by your doctor. It's important to get treatment. If you don't, the injury may become a long-lasting problem. There are two ways to treat the injury: \r\n        \r\n          Exercises and training, also called rehab. It takes several months of rehab for your knee to get better.\r\n           Surgery. You and your doctor can decide if rehab is enough or if surgery is right for you. \r\n        \r\n        If you have surgery, you will also have several months of rehab afterward.\r\n         Your treatment will depend on how much of the ACL is torn, whether other parts of the knee are injured, how active you are, your age, your overall health, and how long ago the injury occurred.\r\n         There are three main treatment goals: \r\n        \r\n          Make the knee stable if it is unsteady, or at least make it stable enough to do your daily activities.\r\n           Make your knee strong enough to do all the activities you used to do.\r\n           Reduce the chance that your knee will be damaged more.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        How can you prevent ACL injuries?\r\n        The best way to prevent ACL injuries is to stretch and strengthen the leg muscles, especially the front and back muscles of the thigh (quadriceps and hamstrings).\r\n         Here are other things you can do that may help prevent ACL injuries:\r\n        \r\n           Avoid wearing shoes with cleats in contact sports.\r\n           Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes.\r\n          Avoid sports that involve lots of twisting and contact.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Frequently Asked Questions\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Learning about anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What are the ACL and an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What causes an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Can I prevent it?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the symptoms?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What happens in an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What increases my risk?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Why do women have more ACL injuries than men?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury classified?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Being diagnosed:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Who can diagnose an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury diagnosed?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Getting treatment:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury treated?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What medicines will I need to take?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Will I need surgery?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do to treat an ACL injury at home?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                   Should I have surgery for my ACL injury?\r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Living with an ACL injury:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do at home for an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  When should I call my doctor?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Will I be able to return to sports?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the long-term consequences?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.

{"topic": "Acoustic Neuroma", "content": "\r\n        An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve. Also known as the vestibulocochlear nerve, it connects the inner ear with the brain and has two different parts. One part is involved in transmitting sound; the other helps send balance information from the inner ear to the brain.\r\n        Acoustic neuromas -- sometimes called vestibular schwannomas or neurolemmomas -- usually grow slowly over a period of years. Although they do not actually invade the brain, they can push on it as they grow. Larger tumors can press on nearby cranial nerves that control the muscles of facial expression and sensation. If tumors become large enough to press on the brain stem or cerebellum, they can be deadly.\r\n      \r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Symptoms\r\n        The early symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often subtle. Many people attribute the symptoms to normal changes of aging, so it may be a while before the condition is diagnosed.\r\n        The first symptom is usually a gradual loss of hearing in one ear, often accompanied by ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or a feeling of fullness in the ear. Less commonly, acoustic neuromas may cause sudden hearing loss.\r\n        Other symptoms, which may occur over time, include:\r\n        \r\n          Problems with balance\r\n          \r\n            Vertigo (feeling like the world is spinning)\r\n          Facial numbness and tingling, which may be constant or come and go\r\n          Facial weakness\r\n          Taste changes\r\n          Difficulty swallowing and hoarseness\r\n          \r\n            Headaches\r\n          \r\n          Clumsiness or unsteadiness\r\n          Confusion\r\n        \r\n        It's important to see your doctor if you experience these symptoms. Symptoms like clumsiness and mental confusion can signal a serious problem that requires urgent treatment.\r\n      \r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Causes\r\n        There are two types of acoustic neuroma: a sporadic form and a form associated with a syndrome called neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). NF2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system. Acoustic neuromas are the most common of these tumors and often occur in both ears by age 30.\r\n        NF2 is a rare disorder. It accounts for only 5% of acoustic neuromas. This means the vast majority are the sporadic form. Doctors aren't certain what causes the sporadic form. One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation, especially to the head and neck.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Acoustic Neuroma Treatments\r\n        There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma:\r\n        \r\n          Observation\r\n          Surgery\r\n          Radiation therapy\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Observation is also called watchful waiting. Because acoustic neuromas are not cancerous and grow slowly, immediate treatment may not be necessary. Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms.\r\n        \r\n          Surgery for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor.\r\n        There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:\r\n        \r\n          Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear. This procedure is used for tumors larger than 3 centimeters. The upside of this approach is that it allows the surgeon to see an important cranial nerve (the facial nerve) clearly before removing the tumor. The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss.\r\n          Retrosigmoid/sub-occipital, which involves exposing the back of the tumor by opening the skull near the back of the head. This approach can be used for removing tumors of any size and offers the possibility of preserving hearing.\r\n          Middle fossa, which involves removing a small piece of bone above the ear canal to access and remove small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal, the narrow passageway from the brain to the middle and inner ear. Using this approach may enable surgeons to preserve a patient's hearing.\r\n        \r\n        A newer, less invasive technique called total endoscopic resection enables surgeons to remove acoustic neuromas using a small camera inserted through a hole in the skull. This technique is offered only at major medical centers with specially trained surgeons. Initial studies show success rates similar to those with conventional surgery.\r\n        \r\n          Radiation therapy is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas. State-of-the-art delivery techniques make it possible to send high doses of radiation to the tumor while limiting expose and damage to surrounding tissue.\r\n        Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways:\r\n        \r\n          Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in which many hundreds of small beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor in a single session.\r\n          Multi-session fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FRS), which delivers smaller doses of radiation daily, generally over several weeks. Early studies suggest multi-session therapy may preserve hearing better than SRS.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Both of these are outpatient procedures, which means they don't require a hospital stay. They work by causing tumor cells to die. The tumor's growth may slow or stop or it may even shrink, but radiation doesn't completely remove the tumor.\r\n        Other types of radiation therapy have also been used. Your doctor will explain your options to you.\r\n        Selecting the right treatment depends on a number of factors, including:\r\n        \r\n          Size of the tumor\r\n          Whether the tumor is growing\r\n          Your age\r\n          Other medical conditions you may have\r\n          Severity of your symptoms and their impact on your life\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Lisa  Bernstein, MD on July 13, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES: UCLA Health System: \"Acoustic Neuroma Brain Tumor.\" Acoustic Neuroma Foundation: \"What Is Acoustic Neuroma?\" Acoustic Neuroma Association: \"Symptoms of Acoustic Neuroma.\" American Hearing Research Foundation: \"Acoustic Neuroma.\" Genetics Home Reference: \"Neurofibromatosis type 2.\"Acoustic Neuroma Association: \"Treatment Options.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Avian Flu", "content": "\r\n        What is bird flu?\r\n        \r\n          Bird flu is an infection caused by a certain kind of avian influenza virus. Although there are many kinds of bird flu, the most common kinds that concern health workers are H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses. These viruses are found in wild birds. Most of the time, wild birds don't get sick from the virus. But wild birds can easily pass the virus to birds that are being raised for food, such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The virus can cause them to get very sick.\r\n        Usually bird flu virus is not passed from birds to people. But since 1997, some people have become sick with this serious, deadly kind of bird flu. Most of these infections have been in Asian countries among people who have had close contact with birds raised on farms.\r\n      \r\n        What causes bird flu?\r\n        Bird flu is caused by a virus. After a wild bird infects a farm-raised bird, the virus can easily and quickly spread among hundreds or thousands of birds. Sick birds must then be killed to stop the virus from spreading.\r\n        People who come into contact with sick chickens, ducks, or turkeys are more likely to get the virus. Bird flu virus can be passed through bird droppings and saliva on surfaces such as cages, tractors, and other farm equipment.\r\n        Most people don't need to worry about getting sick with bird flu virus. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked chicken, turkey, or duck, because heat kills the virus.\r\n      \r\n        Why are people so worried about bird flu?\r\n        In a few cases, bird flu was passed from one person to another person, not from a bird to a person. But this was very rare. The bird flu virus can make people sicker than other kinds of flu viruses. Even though only a few hundred people are known to have been sick with bird flu, more than half of them have died.\r\n        Experts also worry because the bird flu virus is so different from other flu viruses that our bodies do not have immunity against it. Not having immunity means that our bodies have a hard time fighting the virus. It also means that anyone, including those who are otherwise very healthy, can get seriously ill if he or she gets bird flu.\r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        At first, the symptoms of bird flu can be the same as common flu symptoms, such as:\r\n        \r\n          A fever.\r\n          A cough.\r\n          A sore throat.\r\n          Muscle aches.\r\n        \r\n        Sometimes bird flu also can cause other symptoms, such as:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Vomiting or diarrhea.\r\n           An eye infection (conjunctivitis).\r\n        \r\n        Bird flu can quickly progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious lung problem that can be deadly. For the people who die from bird flu, the average length of time from the start of symptoms until death is 9 to 10 days.1\r\n        Call your doctor right away if you have traveled somewhere or live in an area where there is bird flu and you have a fever and a hard time breathing.\r\n      \r\n        How is bird flu diagnosed and treated?\r\n        If your doctor thinks that you may have bird flu, he or she will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms and past health. Your doctor will also ask where you live, where you have traveled recently, and if you have been near any birds. Then your doctor may order blood tests, nasal swabs, or other tests, such as X-rays, to help find out what is making you sick.\r\n        Some questions your doctor might ask are:\r\n        \r\n          Have you been within 3 ft (1 m) of live, sick, or dead poultry, or with wild birds?\r\n          Have you eaten raw or poorly cooked poultry or eggs?\r\n          Have you had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with someone from an area affected with a bird flu virus who has a severe respiratory illness or who later died from an unknown cause?\r\n          Are you a lab or poultry worker who might have been exposed to a bird flu virus?\r\n        \r\n        How bird flu is treated depends on what the virus is doing to your body. In some cases, antiviral medicines may help you feel better. But experts are concerned that certain antiviral medicines may not work against bird flu.\r\n        If you have bird flu, you will stay in a private hospital room (isolation room) to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to others. When your doctors and nurses are caring for you, they will wear gloves and gowns. Some people who have bird flu may need a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe better. Other people may need a machine to help the kidneys work better (dialysis). More than half of the time, bird flu leads to death.\r\n      Continued\r\n        How can bird flu be prevented?\r\n         The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are preparing for the possibility that bird flu could spread to people all over the world in what is called a pandemic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved human vaccines to protect against bird flu. But immunization is not available for the public right now. The vaccines are kept in a U.S. government stockpile.2 Officials are also storing up large supplies of antiviral medicines. The U.S. government has also developed a flu plan. This is a plan to prepare for a pandemic and to make sure that as few people as possible get the virus.\r\n        International health organizations now require that all infected birds be killed. Some countries have programs to clean up poultry farms and to check that all birds are healthy before they are sold. In 2004, the United States stopped buying poultry from most Asian countries.\r\n         Even though there is a lot of talk about bird flu, most people in the United States don't have to worry about getting it. As of April 2012, no cases of bird flu in humans had been found in the U.S. But you can take steps to lower your chances of getting infected.\r\n        \r\n          If you live in an area with bird flu, or if you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu: Avoid poultry farms, poultry-processing factories or plants, and close contact with chickens, turkeys, or ducks.Stay away from open-air markets where live birds are sold.\r\n          If you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu, ask your doctor about getting a regular flu shot. It is best to do this at least 2 weeks before you leave. This will not prevent bird flu, but it may help you avoid getting the regular flu.\r\n          Keep your hands clean by washing them often with soap and warm water or using a hand gel that kills germs. If you use a hand gel, be sure to buy only gels made with alcohol. They do the best job of cleaning your hands.\r\n          Do not eat raw or poorly cooked eggs or poultry. But you can safely eat fully cooked eggs and fully cooked chicken, duck, and turkey, because heat kills the virus.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Latest information about avian influenza\r\n        These organizations are studying and keeping track of bird flu, including what is being done to prevent its spread. Their websites have the most up-to-date information about bird flu:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            U.S. government.

{"topic": "Acute Renal Failure ", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Is this topic for you?\r\n        This topic provides\r\n\t\t\t information about sudden kidney injury. If you are looking for information\r\n\t\t\t about long-term kidney disease, see the topic\r\n\t\t\t Chronic Kidney Disease.\r\n      \r\n        What is acute kidney injury?\r\n        Acute kidney injury\r\n\t\t\t (which used to be called acute renal failure) means that your\r\n\t\t\t kidneys  have suddenly stopped working normally. Your kidneys\r\n\t\t\t remove waste products and help balance water and salt and other minerals (electrolytes) in your blood. When your kidneys stop\r\n\t\t\t working, waste products, fluids, and electrolytes build up in your body. This\r\n\t\t\t can cause problems that can be deadly.\r\n      \r\n        What causes acute kidney injury?\r\n        Acute kidney injury has three main causes:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            A sudden, serious drop in blood flow to the kidneys. Heavy blood loss, an injury, or a bad\r\n\t\t\t\tinfection called\r\n\t\t\t\tsepsis can reduce blood flow to the kidneys. Not\r\n\t\t\t\tenough fluid in the body (dehydration) also can harm the\r\n\t\t\t\tkidneys.\r\n          \r\n            Damage from some medicines, poisons, or infections. Most people don't have any kidney problems from taking\r\n\t\t\t\tmedicines. But people who have serious, long-term health problems are more likely\r\n\t\t\t\tthan other people to have a kidney problem from medicines. Examples of medicines that\r\n\t\t\t\tcan sometimes harm the kidneys include: \r\n\t\t\t\tAntibiotics, such as gentamicin and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t streptomycin.Pain medicines, such as naproxen and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t ibuprofen.Some blood pressure medicines, such as ACE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t inhibitors.The dyes used in some X-ray tests.\r\n          \r\n            A sudden blockage that stops urine from flowing out of the kidneys. Kidney stones, a tumor, an\r\n\t\t\t\tinjury, or an enlarged prostate gland can cause a blockage.\r\n        \r\n        You have a greater chance of getting acute kidney injury\r\n\t\t\t if:\r\n        \r\n          You are an older adult.\r\n          You have\r\n\t\t\t\ta long-term health problem such as kidney or liver disease,\r\n\t\t\t\tdiabetes,\r\n\t\t\t\thigh blood pressure,\r\n\t\t\t\theart failure, or\r\n\t\t\t\tobesity.\r\n          You are already very ill and are\r\n\t\t\t\tin the hospital or intensive care (ICU). Heart or belly surgery or a\r\n\t\t\t\tbone marrow transplant can make you more likely to\r\n\t\t\t\thave kidney problems.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n         Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include:\r\n        \r\n          Little or no urine when you\r\n\t\t\t\ttry to urinate.\r\n          Swelling, especially in your legs and feet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n          Not feeling like eating.\r\n          Nausea and\r\n\t\t\t\tvomiting.\r\n          Feeling confused, anxious and restless, or\r\n\t\t\t\tsleepy.\r\n          Pain in the back just below the rib cage. This is called\r\n\t\t\t\tflank pain.\r\n        \r\n         Some people may not have any symptoms. And for people who are already quite ill, the problem that's causing the kidney injury may be causing other symptoms. \r\n      Continued\r\n        How is acute kidney injury diagnosed?\r\n        Acute kidney injury is most often diagnosed during a hospital stay for another cause. If you are already in the hospital, tests done for other problems\r\n\t\t  may find your kidney problem. \r\n        If you're not in the hospital but have symptoms of kidney injury, your doctor\r\n\t\t\t will ask about your symptoms, what medicines you take, and what tests\r\n\t\t\t you have had. Your symptoms can help point to the cause of your kidney\r\n\t\t\t problem.\r\n        Blood and urine tests can check how well your kidneys are\r\n\t\t\t working. A chemistry screen can show if you have normal levels of\r\n\t\t\t sodium (salt),\r\n\t\t\t potassium, and\r\n\t\t\t calcium. You may also have an\r\n\t\t\t ultrasound. This imaging test lets your doctor see\r\n\t\t\t a picture of your kidneys.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        Your doctor or a kidney\r\n\t\t\t specialist (nephrologist) will try to treat the problem that is causing your\r\n\t\t\t kidney injury. Treatment can vary widely, depending on the cause. For example, your doctor may need to restore blood flow to the kidneys, stop any medicines that may be causing the problem, or remove or bypass a blockage in the urinary tract. \r\n        At the same time, the doctor will try to:\r\n        \r\n          Stop wastes from building up in your body.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou may have\r\n\t\t\t\tdialysis. This treatment uses a machine to do the work\r\n\t\t\t\tof your kidneys until they recover. It will help you feel\r\n\t\t\t\tbetter.\r\n          Prevent other problems. You may take antibiotics to prevent\r\n\t\t\t\tor treat infections. You also may take other medicines to get rid of extra\r\n\t\t\t\tfluid and keep your body's minerals in balance.\r\n        \r\n        You can help yourself heal by taking your medicines as\r\n\t\t\t your doctor tells you to. You also may need to follow a special diet to keep\r\n\t\t\t your kidneys from working too hard. You may need to limit sodium, potassium,\r\n\t\t\t and\r\n\t\t\t phosphorus. A dietitian can help you plan\r\n\t\t\t meals.\r\n      \r\n        Does acute kidney injury cause lasting problems?\r\n        Doctors sometimes  can fix the problems that cause kidney\r\n\t\t\t injury. The treatment takes a few days or weeks. These people's kidneys will work well enough\r\n\t\t\t for them to live normal lives.\r\n        But other people may have permanent\r\n\t\t\t kidney damage that leads to\r\n\t\t\t chronic kidney disease. A small number of them\r\n\t\t  will need to have regular\r\n\t\t  dialysis or a\r\n\t\t  kidney transplant. Older people and those who are\r\n\t\t\t very sick from other health problems may not get better. People who die usually\r\n\t\t\t do so because of the health problem that caused their kidneys to fail. \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.

{"topic": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. AML usually develops from cells that would turn into white blood cells (other than lymphocytes). Sometimes, though, it can develop from other types of blood-forming cells. Here is basic information about the symptoms, risk factors, survival rates, and treatments for AML.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Acute Myeloid Leukemia?\r\n        Acute myeloid leukemia starts in the bone marrow. This is the soft inner parts of bones. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells don't mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, often called blast cells, just keep building up.\r\n        You may hear other names for acute myeloid leukemia. Doctors may call it:\r\n        \r\n          Acute myelocytic leukemia\r\n          Acute myelogenous leukemia\r\n          Acute granulocytic leukemia\r\n          Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia\r\n        \r\n        Without treatment, AML can quickly be fatal. Because it's \"acute,\" this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body such as the following organs:\r\n        \r\n          Lymph nodes\r\n          \r\n            Liver\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Spleen\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Brain and spinal cord\r\n          Testicles\r\n        \r\n        The expected outcome for acute myeloid leukemia depends on certain factors. And of course, prognosis is better if your leukemia responds well to treatment. Your outlook is better if:\r\n        \r\n          You are younger than age 60\r\n          You do not have a history of blood disorders or cancers\r\n          You do not have certain gene mutations or chromosome changes\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Risk Factors for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        If something increases your risk of getting a disease, it's called a risk factor. Risk factors don't tell the whole story. For example, you can have few risk factors and still get a disease or have several and not get it.\r\n        Acute myeloid leukemia risk factors include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Smoking\r\n          \r\n          Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene (a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke), certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers\r\n          Treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers, such as mechlorethamine, procarbazine, and chlorambucil -- especially when combined with radiation therapy\r\n          Exposure to high doses of radiation\r\n          Certain blood disorders, such as myeloproliferative disorders (for example, chronic myelogenous leukemia)\r\n          Certain congenital syndromes, such as Down syndrome\r\n          Being male\r\n        \r\n        For most people, the cause of AML is unknown. There is not a way to prevent it, but you may reduce your risk by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to chemicals.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        If you have any of the symptoms mentioned below, it's important to have a doctor check them out right away to determine the cause.\r\n        AML can cause a variety of signs and symptoms. Since the symptoms are often vague, they could be caused by other conditions. Symptoms include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fatigue\r\n          \r\n          Fever\r\n          Loss of appetite or weight\r\n          \r\n            Night sweats\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        Many symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia are the result of a shortage of normal blood cells. That's because leukemia cells crowd out normal cells in the bone marrow.\r\n        \r\n          A shortage of red blood cells may cause symptoms of anemia including:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fatigue or weakness\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness\r\n          \r\n          Feeling cold\r\n          Light-headedness\r\n          \r\n            Headaches\r\n          \r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          A shortage of normal white blood cells may result in:\r\n        \r\n          Recurring infections\r\n          \r\n            Fevers\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          A shortage of blood platelets may cause symptoms such as:\r\n        \r\n          Lots of bruising for no clear reason\r\n          Frequent or severe nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or other unusual bleeding, such as from minor cuts\r\n        \r\n        Depending upon where leukemia cells are present, other symptoms may include:\r\n        \r\n          Bone or joint pain\r\n          A full or swollen belly from leukemia cells in the liver or spleen\r\n          Lumps or rashes in the skin\r\n          Swollen, painful, bleeding gums\r\n          \r\n            Headache, trouble with balance, vomiting, seizures, or blurred vision\r\n          \r\n            Enlarged lymph nodes such as in the neck or groin, under arms, or above the collarbone (rare)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Treatment for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\r\n        Because AML is a group of related diseases, treatment depends upon each subtype as well as on other factors. It is important to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis.\r\n        You may have more than one type of treatment, including:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs -- often two or three -- such as cytarabine, anthracycline drugs, 6-thioguanine, hydroxyurea, or prednisone\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for AML, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain, bone, or testicles; before a stem cell transplant; or, in rare cases, to shrink a tumor that's pressing on the windpipe.\r\n          \r\n            A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation, followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells; Stem cells usually come from a donor, or, less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a \"mini-transplant.\"\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the survival rates for acute myeloid leukemia? The five-year survival rate overall is about 24%. Surviving at least five years indicates a good chance of long-term survival. Survival rates may be better now as this statistic reflects outcomes from 1999 to 2006.\r\n        AML treatment consists of two parts: induction therapy and consolidation therapy, which are both done in the hospital.\r\n        The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by:\r\n        \r\n          Killing as many AML cells as possible\r\n          Returning blood counts to normal over time\r\n          Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time\r\n        \r\n        Even if remission is achieved, you will likely still need more treatment. Consolidation therapy attacks leukemia cells that common blood or marrow tests can't find. This therapy may include chemotherapy, which may be different drugs than those used earlier, and possibly a bone marrow transplant.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Sujana  Movva, MD on April 26, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES: American Cancer Society: \"What is acute myeloid leukemia?\"\"How is acute myeloid leukemia classified?\"\"What are the risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia?\" \"How is acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed?\"and \"Treating Leukemia -- Acute Myeloid (AML) Topics.\"\r\n            Leukemia & Lymphoma Society: \"Leukemia Facts & Statistics\"and \"Acute Myeloid Lymphoma.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Avascular Necrosis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis, is a condition that occurs when there is loss of blood to the bone. Because bone is living tissue that requires blood, an interruption to the blood supply causes bone to die. If not stopped, this process eventually causes the bone to collapse.\r\n        \r\n          Avascular necrosis most commonly occurs in the hip. Other common sites are the shoulder, knees, shoulder, and ankles.\r\n      \r\n        Who Gets Avascular Necrosis and What Causes It?\r\n        As many as 20,000 people develop AVN each year. Most are between ages 20 and 50. For healthy people, the risk of AVN is small. Most cases are the result of an underlying health problem or injury. Possible causes include:\r\n        \r\n          Dislocation or fracture of the thigh bone (femur). This type of injury can affect the blood supply to the bone, leading to trauma-related avascular necrosis. AVN may develop in 20% or more of people who dislocate a hip.\r\n        \r\n          Chronic corticosteroid use. Long-term use of these inflammation-fighting drugs, either orally or intravenously, is associated with 35% of all cases of nontraumatic AVN. Although the reason for this is not completely understood, doctors suspect these drugs may interfere with the body's ability to break down fatty substances. These substances collect in the blood vessels -- making them narrower -- and reduce the amount of blood to the bone.\r\n        \r\n          Excessive alcohol use. Much like corticosteroids, excessive alcohol may cause fatty substances to build in the blood vessels and decrease the blood supply to the bones.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Blood clots, inflammation, and damage to the arteries. All of these can block blood flow to the bones.\r\n        Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Gaucher's disease, an inherited metabolic disorder in which harmful quantities of a fatty substance accumulate in the organs\r\n          \r\n            Sickle cell disease\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas\r\n          \r\n            HIV infection\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy or chemotherapy\r\n          \r\n            Autoimmune diseases\r\n          \r\n          Decompression sickness, a condition that occurs when the body is subjected to a sudden reduction in surrounding pressure, causing the formation of gas bubbles in the blood\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Avascular Necrosis\r\n        In its early stages, AVN typically cause no symptoms; however, as the disease progresses it becomes painful. At first, you may experience pain when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become more constant. If the disease progresses and the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may experience severe pain that interferes with your ability to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and collapse of the bone may range from several months to more than a year.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment for Avascular Necrosis\r\n        The goals of treatment for AVN are to improve or ensure function of the affected joint, stop the progression of bone damage, and reduce pain.\r\n        The best treatment will depend on a number of factors, including:\r\n        \r\n          Your age\r\n          Stage of the disease\r\n          Location and amount of bone damage\r\n          Cause of AVN\r\n        \r\n        If the cause of your avascular necrosis is identified, treatment will include efforts to manage the underlying condition. For example, if AVN is caused by blood clots, your doctor will prescribe medications to dissolve clots. If inflammation of the arteries is responsible, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medicines.\r\n        If avascular necrosis is caught early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee, or ankle is affected, crutches may be necessary to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the affected joint mobile.\r\n        While these nonsurgical treatments may slow the progression of avascular necrosis, most people with the condition eventually need surgery.\r\n        Surgical options include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Bone grafts, which involve removing healthy bone from one part of the body and using it to replace the damaged bone\r\n          \r\n            Osteotomy, a procedure that involves cutting the bone and changing its alignment to relieve stress on the bone or joint\r\n          \r\n            Total joint replacement, which involves removing the damaged joint and replacing it with a synthetic joint\r\n          \r\n            Core decompression, a procedure that involves removing part of the inside of the bone to relieve pressure and allow new blood vessels to form\r\n          \r\n            Vascularized bone graft, a procedure that uses the patient's own tissue to rebuild diseased or damaged hip joints; the surgeon first removes the bone with the poor blood supply from the hip and then replaces it with the blood-vessel-rich bone from another site, such as the fibula, the smaller bone located in the lower leg.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David  Zelman, MD on September 01, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            National Osteonecrosis Foundation: \"Osteonecrosis.\"\r\n            MedlinePlus.gov: \"Osteonecrosis.\"\r\n            Penn State Hershey Medical Center: \"Avascular Necrosis.\"\r\n            DukeHealth.org: \"Free Vascularized Fibular Graft.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. Also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia, it is the least common type of leukemia in adults. Here's what you need to know about symptoms, prognosis, survival rates, and treatment for ALL.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia?\r\n        ALL is a type of leukemia that starts from white blood cells in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones. It develops from cells called lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell central to the immune system, or from lymphoblasts, an immature type of lymphocyte.\r\n        Acute lymphoblastic leukemia invades the blood and can spread throughout the body to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. But it does not normally produce tumors as do many types of cancer. It is an acute type of leukemia, which means it can progress quickly. Without treatment, it can be fatal within a few months.\r\n        The outlook for acute lymphoblastic leukemia depends on factors such as:\r\n        \r\n          Your age: Younger patients tend to have a better outlook.\r\n          Your lab test results: The prognosis is better if you have a lower white blood count when you're diagnosed.\r\n          Your subtype of ALL (B-cell ALL or T-cell ALL)\r\n          Whether you have a chromosome abnormality called the Philadelphia chromosome; having it suggests a poorer prognosis.\r\n          Your response to chemotherapy: The prognosis is better if you have no evidence of leukemia four to five weeks after starting treatment.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Risk Factors for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n        For most people, the cause of ALL is unknown. For this reason, there is no known way to prevent it. However, there are a few known risk factors for this type of leukemia. This means these factors may increase your chances of getting acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But it is not yet known whether these risk factors are actual causes of the disease:\r\n        \r\n          Exposure to high levels of radiation to treat other types of cancer\r\n          Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene, a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke, certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers\r\n          Infection with human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) in rarer cases outside the U.S., or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a related leukemia more commonly seen in Africa\r\n          Having an inherited genetic syndrome such as Down syndrome\r\n          Being white\r\n          Being male\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n      \r\n        Treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\r\n        ALL is really a group of related diseases, or subtypes. Therefore, your treatment options depend upon your subtype and other factors. You may have more than one type of treatment. These include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              Chemotherapy, the use of anticancer drugs in combination, generally over a couple of years. Agents used for ALL include: vincristine (Oncovin),cytarabine (Cytosar)daunorubicin (Cerubidine) or doxorubicin (Adriamycin)L-asparaginace (Elspar) or PEG-L-asapraginase (Oncaspar)etoposide (VP-16)teniposide (Vumon)6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, Purinethol)methotrexatecyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Targeted therapy, drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells and tend to have fewer or less severe side effects than chemotherapy; examples include imatinib (Gleevec), dasatinib (Sprycel), blinatumomab (Blincyto), ponatinib (Iclusig), and nilotinib (Tasigna), which attack cells with the Philadelphia chromosome.\r\n          \r\n            Radiation therapy, the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; this is not used often for ALL, but may be used to treat leukemia in the brain or bone, for example, or before a stem cell transplant.\r\n          \r\n            A bone marrow transplant, which involves use of high doses of chemotherapy and possibly radiation followed by a transplant of bone-forming stem cells; stem cells usually come from a donor, or less likely, from your own bone marrow or peripheral blood. If you cannot tolerate high doses of chemotherapy and radiation, lower doses may be used with a \"mini-transplant.\"\r\n        \r\n        Treatment occurs in two parts -- induction therapy and post-induction therapy.\r\n        The goal of induction therapy is to achieve remission by:\r\n        \r\n          Killing as many leukemia cells as possible\r\n          Returning blood counts to normal\r\n          Ridding the body of signs of disease for a long time\r\n        \r\n        About eight or nine out of 10 adults achieve remission after treatments, but many relapse, which lowers the overall cure rate to 30% to 40%. So even with remission, post-induction therapy is needed to prevent relapse. It involves cycles of treatment over two to three years. Usually, the drugs are different than the drugs used in induction therapy. The goal is to completely rid the body of leukemia cells that have not been found by common blood or marrow tests.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Sujana  Movva, MD on April 26, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            American Cancer Society: \"What is acute lymphocytic leukemia?\"\"How is acute lymphocytic leukemia classified?\"\"What are the risk factors for acute lymphocytic leukemia?\"\"How is acute lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed?\"\"Treating Leukemia -- Acute Lymphocytic (ALL) in Adults;\"and \"Response rates to treatment.\"\r\n            The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society: \"Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\"and \"Leukemia Facts & Statistics.\"\r\n            ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Appendicitis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a 3 1/2-inch-long tube of tissue that extends from the large intestine. No one is absolutely certain what the function of the appendix is. One thing we do know: We can live without it, without apparent consequences.\r\n        Appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgery to remove the appendix. Left untreated, an inflamed appendix will eventually burst, or perforate, spilling infectious materials into the abdominal cavity. This can lead to peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the abdominal cavity's lining (the peritoneum) that can be fatal unless it is treated quickly with strong antibiotics.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Sometimes a pus-filled abscess (infection that is walled off from the rest of the body) forms outside the inflamed appendix. Scar tissue then \"walls off\" the appendix from the rest of the abdomen, preventing infection from spreading. An abscessed appendix is a less urgent situation, but unfortunately, it can't be identified without surgery. For this reason, all cases of appendicitis are treated as emergencies, requiring surgery.\r\n        In the U.S., one in 15 people will get appendicitis. Although it can strike at any age, appendicitis is rare under age 2 and most common between ages 10 and 30.\r\n        \r\n          What Causes Appendicitis?\r\n        \r\n        Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes blocked, often by stool, a foreign body, or cancer. Blockage may also occur from infection, since the appendix swells in response to any infection in the body.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          What Are the Symptoms of Appendicitis?\r\n        \r\n        The classic symptoms of appendicitis include:\r\n        \r\n          Dull pain near the navel or the upper abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen. This is usually the first sign.\r\n          Loss of appetite\r\n          Nausea and/or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins\r\n          Abdominal swelling\r\n          Fever of 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit\r\n          Inability to pass gas\r\n        \r\n        Almost half the time, other symptoms of appendicitis appear, including:\r\n        \r\n          Dull or sharp pain anywhere in the upper or lower abdomen, back, or rectum\r\n          \r\n            Painful urination\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Vomiting that precedes the abdominal pain\r\n          Severe cramps\r\n          \r\n            Constipation or diarrhea with gas\r\n        \r\n        If you have any of the mentioned symptoms, seek medical attention immediately, because timely diagnosis and treatment is very important. Do not eat, drink, or use any pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture.\r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          How Is Appendicitis Diagnosed?\r\n        \r\n        Diagnosing appendicitis can be tricky. Symptoms of appendicitis are frequently vague or extremely similar to other ailments, including gallbladder problems, bladder or urinary tract infection, Crohn's disease, gastritis, intestinal infection, and ovary problems.\r\n        The following tests are usually used to make the diagnosis:\r\n        \r\n          Abdominal exam to detect inflammation\r\n          \r\n            Urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection\r\n          \r\n            Rectal exam\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Blood test to see if your body is fighting infection\r\n          CT scans and/or ultrasound\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          How Is Appendicitis Treated?\r\n        \r\n        Surgery to remove the appendix, which is called an appendectomy, is the standard treatment for appendicitis.\r\n        Generally, if appendicitis is suspected, doctors tend to err on the side of safety and quickly remove the appendix to avoid its rupture. If the appendix has formed an abscess, you may have two procedures: one to drain the abscess of pus and fluid, and a later one to remove the appendix. However, there is some research showing that treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics may eliminate the need for surgery.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Appendectomy: What to Expect\r\n        Antibiotics are given before an appendectomy to fight possible peritonitis. General anesthesia is usually given, and the appendix is removed through a 4-inch incision or by laparoscopy. If you have peritonitis, the abdomen is also irrigated and drained of pus.\r\n        Within 12 hours of surgery you may get up and move around. You can usually return to normal activities in two to three weeks. If surgery is done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen), the incision is smaller and recovery is faster.\r\n        After an appendectomy, call your doctor if you have:\r\n        \r\n          Uncontrolled vomiting\r\n          Increased pain in your abdomen\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness/feelings of faintness\r\n          \r\n            Blood in your vomit or urine\r\n          Increased pain and redness in your incision\r\n          Fever\r\n          Pus in the wound\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Can Appendicitis Be Prevented?\r\n        \r\n        There is no way to prevent appendicitis. However, appendicitis is less common in people who eat foods high in fiber, such as fresh fruits and vegetables.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Varnada  Karriem-Norwood, MD on August 30, 2014\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Di Saverio, S.

{"topic": "Arrhythmia", "content": "\r\n        \"Arrhythmia\" means your heartbeat is irregular. It doesn't necessarily mean your heart is beating too fast or too slow. It just means it's out of its normal rhythm.\r\n        It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, is \"fluttering,\" or is beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or, you might not notice anything, since some arrhythmias are \"silent.\"\r\n        Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they may be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, call 911 so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it.\r\n      \r\n        Causes and Types of of Arrhythmias\r\n        You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. Or it could happen because you have:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Heart disease\r\n          \r\n          The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood\r\n          Changes in your heart muscle\r\n          Injury from a heart attack\r\n          Healing process after heart surgery\r\n        \r\n        The many types of arrhythmias include:\r\n        \r\n          Premature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats that start in the heart's upper chambers, called the atria. They are harmless and generally don't need treatment.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These are among the most common arrhythmias. They're the \"skipped heartbeat\" we all occasionally feel. They can be related to stress or too much caffeine or nicotine. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. If you have a lot of PVCs, or symptoms linked to them, see a heart doctor (cardiologist).\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Atrial fibrillation. This common irregular heart rhythm causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally.\r\n        \r\n          Atrial flutter. This is an arrhythmia that's usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. It happens most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often changes to atrial fibrillation.\r\n        \r\n          Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, starting from above the heart's lower chambers, or ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly.\r\n        \r\n          Accessory pathway tachycardias. You can get a rapid heart rate because there is an extra pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers. It's just like if there was an extra road on your way home as well as your usual route, so cars can move around faster. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast heart rhythm, which doctors call tachycardia. The impulses that control your heart rhythm travel around the heart very quickly, making it beat unusually fast.\r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. This is another type of fast heartbeat. It's caused by there being an extra pathway through a part of the heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In some cases, you can stop it simply by breathing in and bearing down. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm.\r\n        \r\n          Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). A rapid heart rhythm starting from the heart's lower chambers. Because the heart is beating too fast, it can't fill up with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia -- especially in people with heart disease -- and it may be linked to other symptoms.\r\n        \r\n          Ventricular fibrillation. This happens when the heart's lower chambers quiver and can't contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible.\r\n        \r\n          Long QT syndrome. This may cause potentially dangerous arrhythmias and sudden death. Doctors can treat it with medications or devices called defibrillators.\r\n        \r\n          Bradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms, which may be due to disease in the heart's electrical system. If you experience this, call your doctor.\r\n        \r\n          Sinus node dysfunction. This slow heart rhythm is due to a problem with the heart's sinus node. Some people with this type of arrhythmia need a pacemaker.\r\n        \r\n          Heart block. There is a delay or a complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the heart's sinus node to its lower chambers. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. In serious cases, you'd get a pacemaker.\r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Arrhythmias\r\n        An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. A doctor can find an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse or through an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).\r\n        If you do have symptoms, they may include:\r\n        \r\n          Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heart beats, fluttering or \"flip-flops\")\r\n          Pounding in your chest\r\n          \r\n            Dizziness or feeling light-headed\r\n          Fainting\r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n          \r\n            Chest pain or tightness\r\n          \r\n            Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired)\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Diagnosis of Arrhythmias\r\n        To diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests including:\r\n        \r\n          Electrocardiogram -- Also called an EKG or ECG, this test records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office.\r\n        \r\n          Holter monitor -- This is a portable EKG that you'll use for 1 to 2 days. You'll have electrodes taped to your skin. It's painless and you can do everything but shower while wearing the electrodes.\r\n        \r\n          Event monitor -- If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest you wear one of these, usually for about a month. This is a device that, when you push a button, will record and store your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Each time you notice symptoms, you should try to get a reading on the monitor. Your doctor will interpret the results.\r\n        \r\n          Stress test -- There are different kinds of stress tests. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a heart rhythm problem or not getting enough blood flow to the heart. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty while you're getting an EKG and getting your heart rate and blood pressure monitored.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Echocardiogram\r\n          -- This test uses ultrasound to evaluate heart muscle and heart valves.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Cardiac catheterization\r\n          -- Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. She will guide it to your heart with help from a special X-ray machine. Then she'll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart's valves, coronary arteries, and chambers.\r\n        \r\n          Electrophysiology study -- This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which controls it best, or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it.\r\n        \r\n          Head-up tilt table test -- Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up or lying down. You'll get this test in a lab. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you're getting an EKG and specialists are checking your blood pressure and oxygen level.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment of Arrhythmias\r\n        Treatment depends on the type and seriousness of your arrhythmia. Some people with arrhythmias don't need treatment. Others may need medication, making lifestyle changes, and surgery.\r\n        Drugs that treat arrhythmias include:\r\n        \r\n          Antiarrhythmic drugs. These drugs control heart rhythm and include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.\r\n        \r\n          Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. These drugs lower the risk of blood clots and stroke. These include the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin. Other blood thinners called apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) have been approved to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation.\r\n        Everyone is different. Finding the medicine and dose that works best for you may take some time.\r\n        \r\n          If you notice that your arrhythmia happens more often with certain activities, stop doing them.\r\n          If you smoke, stop.\r\n          Limit alcohol to no more than one drink a day for women, and two drinks a day for men.\r\n          Limit or stop using caffeine.\r\n          Don't use cough and cold medications that have stimulants. Read the label and ask your doctor or pharmacist what medication would be best for you.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What Is Electrical Cardioversion?\r\n        If drugs can't control a persistent irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, doctors, give you a short-acting anesthesia, then deliver an electrical shock to your chest wall to allow the normal rhythm to restart.\r\n      \r\n        What Is a Pacemaker?\r\n        This device sends small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. The pacemaker has a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and wires that send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle.\r\n      \r\n        What Is an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)?\r\n        Doctors mainly use ICDs to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms.\r\n        The ICD constantly tracks the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. There are several ways the ICD can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. They include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). When the heart beats too fast, you get a series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Cardioversion. You may get a low-energy shock at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Defibrillation. When the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly, the heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a normal rhythm.\r\n          \r\n            Anti-bradycardia pacing. Many ICDs provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        What Is Catheter Ablation?\r\n        You can think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem within the heart.\r\n        The doctor will insert a catheter through the leg. The catheter delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside the heart that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy \"disconnects\" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm.\r\n        Doctors use ablation to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Some people also need other procedures.\r\n      \r\n        Heart Surgery for Arrhythmias\r\n        The Maze procedure is a type of surgery used to correct atrial fibrillation. During this procedure, the surgeon makes a series, or \"maze,\" of cuts in the heart's upper chambers. The goal is to keep the heart's electrical impulses only on certain pathways. Some people may need a pacemaker afterward.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Jennifer  Robinson, MD on April 21, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCE:\r\n            News release, FDA.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Ankle Osteoarthritis", "content": "\r\n        As you age, your chance of developing osteoarthritis, which is caused by wear and tear, increases. The joint damage associated with osteoarthritis causes swelling, pain, and deformity. Here is information about how osteoarthritis affects the foot and ankle and information you can use to help you manage this debilitating condition.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Arthritis?\r\n        \r\n          Arthritis is a general term for a group of more than 100 diseases. The word \"arthritis\" means \"joint inflammation.\" Arthritis involves inflammation and swelling in and around the body's joints and surrounding soft tissue. The inflammation can cause pain and stiffness.\r\n        In many kinds of arthritis, progressive joint deterioration occurs and the smooth \"cushioning\" cartilage in joints is gradually lost. As a result, the bones rub and wear against each other. Soft tissues in the joints also may begin to wear down. Arthritis can be painful and eventually result in limited motion, loss of joint function, and deformities in the joints affected.\r\n      \r\n        What Is Osteoarthritis?\r\n        \r\n          Osteoarthritis, or \"wear-and-tear\" arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis. Also known as degenerative joint disease or age-related arthritis, osteoarthritis is more likely to develop as people age. Inflammation and injury to the joint cause a breaking down of cartilage tissues, resulting in pain, swelling, and deformity. The changes in osteoarthritis usually occur slowly over many years, though there are occasional exceptions.\r\n      \r\n        How Does Osteoarthritis Affect the Foot and Ankle?\r\n        Each foot has 28 bones and more than 30 joints. The following are the most common foot joints affected by osteoarthritis:\r\n        \r\n          The three joints of the foot that involve the heel bone, the inner mid-foot bone, and the outer mid-foot bone\r\n          The joint of the big toe and foot bone\r\n          The joint where the ankle and shinbone meet\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What Are the Symptoms of Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis?\r\n        Symptoms of foot and ankle osteoarthritis often include:\r\n        \r\n          Tenderness or pain\r\n          Reduced ability to move, walk, or bear weight\r\n          Stiffness in the joint\r\n          Swelling in the joint\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        How Is Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Diagnosed?\r\n        The diagnosis of foot and ankle osteoarthritis most likely will involve:\r\n        \r\n          A medical history\r\n          \r\n            Physical exam\r\n          \r\n          X-rays\r\n          \r\n            Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scans\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        How Is Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Treated?\r\n        Foot and ankle osteoarthritis can be treated in many ways. Nonsurgical methods to treat foot and ankle arthritis include:\r\n        \r\n          Steroid medications injected into the joints\r\n          Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the joints\r\n          Pain relievers\r\n          Pads or arch supports\r\n          Canes or braces to support the joints\r\n          Inserts that support the ankle and foot (orthotics)\r\n          \r\n            Physical therapy\r\n          \r\n          Custom shoes\r\n          \r\n            Weight control\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Tips on Foot Care With Osteoarthritis\r\n        The most essential element of foot care for people with foot and ankle osteoarthritis is to wear shoes that fit properly and feel comfortable. The following are things to look for in finding a comfortable shoe:\r\n        \r\n          Shoes shaped like your foot\r\n          Shoes that have support -- for example, no slip-on shoes\r\n          Rubber soles to provide more cushioning\r\n          Flexibility\r\n          Proper fit -- ask the salesperson to help you with this\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Exercise can help keep your feet pain-free, strong, and flexible. Exercises that can be good for your feet include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Achilles stretch. With your palms flat on a wall, lean against the wall and place one foot forward and one foot back. Lean forward, leaving your heels on the floor. You can feel the pull in your Achilles tendon and your calf. Repeat this exercise three times, holding for 10 seconds on each repeat.\r\n          \r\n            Big-toe stretch. Place a thick rubber band around your big toes. Pull the big toes away from each other and toward the other toes. Hold this position for five seconds and repeat the exercise 10 times.\r\n          \r\n            Toe pull. Place a rubber band around the toes of each foot, and then spread your toes. Hold this position for five seconds and repeat the exercise 10 times.\r\n          \r\n            Toe curl. Pick up marbles with your toes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Is Surgery an Option for Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis?\r\n        More than one kind of surgery may be required to treat foot and ankle osteoarthritis. Your doctor can select the kind of surgery that is best for you, depending on the extent of your arthritis. The following are some of the surgical options for foot and ankle osteoarthritis:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Fusion surgery. This kind of surgery, also called arthrodesis, involves fusing bones together with the use of rods, pins, screws, or plates. After healing, the bones remain fused together.\r\n          \r\n            Joint replacement surgery. This kind of surgery involves replacing the ankle joint with artificial implants and is used only in rare cases.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David  Zelman, MD on July 20, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS): \"What Is Osteoarthritis?\" and \"Hand Out on Health: Osteoarthritis.\"\r\n            National Institute on Aging: \"Age Page: Arthritis Advice.\"\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Anemia", "content": "\r\n        What Is Anemia?\r\n        \r\n          Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.\r\n        \r\n          Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:\r\n        \r\n          Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.\r\n          Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.\r\n          Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.\r\n        \r\n        There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.\r\n      \r\n        What Causes Anemia?\r\n        There are more than 400 types of anemia, which are divided into three groups:\r\n        \r\n          Anemia caused by blood loss\r\n          Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production\r\n          Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Blood Loss\r\n        Red blood cells can be lost through bleeding, which often can occur slowly over a long period of time, and can go undetected. This kind of chronic bleeding commonly results from the following:\r\n        \r\n          Gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers,hemorrhoids,gastritis(inflammation of thestomach), andcancer\r\n          Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such asaspirinoribuprofen, which can cause ulcers and gastritis\r\n          \r\n            Menstruationandchildbirthin women, especially if menstrual bleeding is excessive and if there are multiple pregnancies\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Decreased or Faulty Red Blood Cell Production\r\n        With this type of anemia, the body may produce too few blood cells or the blood cells may not function correctly. In either case, anemia can result. Red blood cells may be faulty or decreased due to abnormal red blood cells or a lack of minerals andvitaminsneeded for red blood cells to work properly. Conditions associated with these causes of anemia include the following:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Sickle cell anemia\r\n          \r\n          Iron-deficiency anemia\r\n          Vitamin deficiency\r\n          Bone marrow and stem cell problems\r\n          Other health conditions\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sickle cell anemiais an inherited disorder that, in the U.S. affects mainly African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Red blood cells become crescent-shaped because of a genetic defect. They break down rapidly, so oxygen does not get to the body's organs, causing anemia. The crescent-shaped red blood cells can also get stuck in tiny blood vessels, causingpain.\r\n        \r\n          Iron-deficiency anemiaoccurs because of a lack of the mineral iron in the body. Bone marrow in the center of the bone needs iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that transports oxygen to the body's organs. Without adequate iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. The result is iron-deficiency anemia. This type of anemia can be caused by:\r\n        \r\n          An iron-poor diet, especially in infants, children,teens, vegans, and vegetarians\r\n          The metabolic demands of pregnancy andbreastfeedingthat deplete a woman's iron stores\r\n          \r\n            Menstruation\r\n          \r\n          Frequentblood donation\r\n          Endurance training\r\n          Digestive conditions such asCrohn's diseaseor surgical removal of part of the stomach or small intestine\r\n          Certain drugs, foods, and caffeinated drinks\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Vitamin-deficiency anemiamay occur whenvitamin B12and folate are deficient. These twovitaminsare needed to make red blood cells. Conditions leading to anemia caused by vitamin deficiency include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Megaloblastic anemia: Vitamin B12 or folate or both are deficient\r\n          \r\n            Pernicious anemia: Poor vitamin B12 absorption caused by conditions such asCrohn's disease, an intestinal parasite infection, surgical removal of part of the stomach or intestine, or infection withHIV\r\n          Dietary deficiency: Eating little or no meat may cause a lack of vitamin B12, while overcooking or eating too few vegetables may cause a folatedeficiency.\r\n          Other causes of vitamin deficiency: pregnancy, certainmedications,alcohol abuse, intestinal diseases such astropical sprueandceliac disease\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        During early pregnancy, sufficientfolic acidcan help prevent thefetusfrom developing neural tube defects such asspina bifida.\r\n        \r\n          Bone marrow and stem cell problemsmay prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells. Some of thestem cellsfound in bone marrow develop into red blood cells. Ifstem cellsare too few, defective, or replaced by other cells such as metastaticcancercells, anemia may result. Anemia resulting from bone marrow or stem cell problems include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Aplastic anemiaoccurs when there's a marked reduction in the number of stem cells or absence of these cells. Aplastic anemia can be inherited, can occur without apparent cause, or can occur when the bone marrow is injured by medications,radiation,chemotherapy, or infection.\r\n          Thalassemia occurs when the red cells can't mature and grow properly. Thalassemia is an inherited condition that typically affects people of Mediterranean, African, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian descent. This condition can range in severity from mild to life-threatening; the most severe form is called Cooley's anemia.\r\n          Lead exposure is toxic to the bone marrow, leading to fewer red blood cells. Lead poisoning occurs in adults from work-related exposure and in children who eat paint chips, for example. Improperly glazed pottery can also taint food and liquids with lead.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia associated with other conditionsusually occurs when there are too few hormones necessary for red blood cell production. Conditions causing this type of anemia include the following:\r\n        \r\n          Advancedkidney disease\r\n          \r\n            Hypothyroidism\r\n          \r\n          Other chronic diseases, such ascancer, infection,lupus,diabetes, andrheumatoid arthritis\r\n          Old age\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Anemia Caused by Destruction of Red Blood Cells\r\n        When red blood cells are fragile and cannot withstand the routine stress of the circulatory system, they may rupture prematurely, causing hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia can be present at birth or develop later. Sometimes there is no known cause. Known causes of hemolytic anemia may include:\r\n        \r\n          Inherited conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia\r\n          Stressors such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods\r\n          Toxins from advancedliveror kidney disease\r\n          Inappropriate attack by the immune system (called hemolytic disease of thenewbornwhen it occurs in thefetusof a pregnant woman)\r\n          Vascular grafts,prostheticheartvalves, tumors, severe burns, exposure to certain chemicals, severehypertension, and clotting disorders\r\n          In rare cases, anenlarged spleencan trap red blood cells and destroy them before their circulating time is up.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Laura J.

{"topic": "Anal Abscess", "content": "\r\n        An anal abscess is a painful condition in which a collection of pus develops near the anus. Most anal abscesses are a result of infection from small anal glands.\r\n        The most common type of abscess is a perianal abscess. This often appears as a painful boil-like swelling near the anus. It may be red in color and warm to the touch. Anal abscesses located in deeper tissue are less common and may be less visible.\r\n        Surgical incision and drainage is the most common treatment for all types of anal abscesses and is usually successful.\r\n        About 50% of patients with an anal abscess will develop a complication called a fistula. A fistula is a small tunnel that makes an abnormal connection between the site of the abscess and the skin.\r\n        In some cases, an anal fistula causes persistent drainage. In other cases, where the outside of the tunnel opening closes, the result may be recurrent anal abscesses. Surgery is needed to cure almost all anal fistulas.\r\n      \r\n        Causes of Anal Abscesses\r\n        An anal abscess can have many different causes. These include:\r\n        \r\n          Infection of an anal fistula. An anal fistula is a small superficial tear in the skin of the anal canal.\r\n          Sexually transmitted infections.\r\n          Blocked anal glands.\r\n        \r\n        Risk factors for anal abscesses include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Colitis\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\r\n          \r\n            Diabetes\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Diverticulitis\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Pelvic inflammatory disease\r\n          \r\n          Being the receptive partner in anal sex\r\n          Use of medications such as prednisone\r\n        \r\n        For adults, using condoms during sexual intercourse, including anal intercourse, can help prevent anal abscesses. For infants and toddlers, frequent diaper changes and proper cleaning during diaper changes can help prevent anal fistulas and perianal abscesses.\r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Superficial anal abscesses are often associated with:\r\n        \r\n          Pain, which is usually constant, throbbing, and worse when sitting down\r\n          Skin irritation around the anus, including swelling, redness, and tenderness\r\n          Discharge of pus\r\n          \r\n            Constipation or pain associated with bowel movements\r\n        \r\n        Deeper anal abscesses may also be associated with:\r\n        \r\n          Fever\r\n          Chills\r\n          Malaise\r\n        \r\n        Sometimes, fever is the only symptom of deep anal abscesses.\r\n      \r\n        Diagnosis of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Usually, a clinical evaluation -- including a digital rectal exam -- is sufficient to diagnose an anal abscess. But some patients may require additional tests to screen for:\r\n        \r\n          Sexually transmitted infections\r\n          \r\n            inflammatory bowel disease\r\n          \r\n          Diverticular disease\r\n          \r\n            Rectal cancer\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        In rare cases, an examination may be done under anesthesia. The doctor may also ask for an ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Treatment of Anal Abscesses\r\n        Prompt surgical drainage is important, preferably before the abscess erupts. Superficial anal abscesses can be drained in a doctor's office using a local anesthetic. Large or deeper anal abscesses may require hospitalization and the assistance of an anesthesiologist.\r\n        After the procedure, most people are prescribed medications for pain relief. For otherwise healthy people, antibiotics are usually not needed. Antibiotics may be required, though, for some people, including those with diabetes or decreased immunity.\r\n        Sometimes, fistula surgery can be performed at the same time as abscess surgery. However, fistulas often develop four to six weeks after an abscess is drained. Sometimes a fistula may not occur until months or even years later. So fistula surgery is usually a separate procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis or with a short hospital stay.\r\n        After abscess or fistula surgery, discomfort is usually mild and can be controlled with pain medications. People can expect to lose only a minimal amount of time from work or school.\r\n        People are usually advised to soak the affected area in a warm water (sitz) bath three or four times per day. Stool softeners may be recommended to ease the discomfort of bowel movements. Some people may be advised to wear a gauze pad or mini-pad to prevent the drainage from soiling their clothes.\r\n        Complications after surgery can include:\r\n        \r\n          Infection\r\n          \r\n            Anal fissure\r\n          \r\n          An abscess returning\r\n          Scarring\r\n        \r\n        After an anal abscess or fistula has properly healed, it's unlikely that the problem will come back. To prevent one from doing so, however, it's important to follow the advice of your doctor or colon and rectal surgeon.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Melinda  Ratini, DO, MS on September 01, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Merck Manual Professional: \"Anorectal Abscess.\"\r\n            Patient.co.uk: \"Anorectal Abscess.\"\r\n            American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons: \"Anal Abscess/Fistula.\"\r\n            MyClevelandClinic.org: \"Anal Abscesses/Fistulae Overview.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Atrial Fibrillation", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Atrial fibrillation is a problem with your heart's electrical activity. You and your doctor have treatment options if your symptoms become too severe. \r\n        With AFib, your heart quivers, beats too quickly, or skips beats. It can't pump blood through its chambers and out to your body as well as it should. Sometimes blood can pool in the heart and form clots, which could lead to a stroke.\r\n        Treatments such as medications, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery can slow your heartbeat and bring it back into a normal rhythm. AFib treatments also prevent clots and help keep your heart healthy.\r\n      \r\n        Medications\r\n        These can slow your heart rate, control your heart rhythm, and prevent clots.\r\n        \r\n          Heart-rate controlling medicines: These slow your rapid heart rate so your heart can pump more effectively. Some of these drugs include:\r\n        \r\n          Beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), bisoprolol (Zebeta), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), and timolol\r\n          Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor) and verapamil (Calan, Covera-HS, Verelan)\r\n          Digoxin (Digox, Lanoxin)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Heart-rhythm \r\n          controlling medicines: They slow the electrical signals to bring your heartbeat into a normal rhythm. These treatments are also called chemical cardioversion.\r\n        These medications include:\r\n        \r\n          Sodium channel blockers such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rythmol), and quinidine\r\n          \r\n            Potassium channel blockers such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone Pacerone), dofetilide (Tikosyn), and sotalol (Betapace, Sorine, Sotylize)\r\n        \r\n        You might get them in your doctor's office or at a hospital. Your doctor will monitor you to make sure the medicine is working.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Blood thinners: They prevent clots and include:\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Apixaban (Eliquis)\r\n          \r\n            Dabigatran (Pradaxa, Xarelto)\r\n          \r\n            Heparin\r\n          \r\n          warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)\r\n          \r\n            Aspirin\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Blood thinners can make you more likely to bruise or bleed too much. You'll see your doctor for a blood test every month to make sure the medication is working and you're on the right dose.\r\n      \r\n        Procedures\r\n        If medicines don't work or they cause side effects, you can try one of two procedures called cardioversion or ablation. These treat AFib without surgery.\r\n        \r\n          Cardioversion: A doctor gives you a mild electric shock to reset your heart rhythm.\r\n        First, you'll have a test called a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to see whether you have any blood clots in the top chambers of your heart, called the atria. If you do have one, you'll need to take blood thinners before the procedure.\r\n      Continued\r\n        You get cardioversion in a hospital after you have been given something that will make you sleep. Electricity travels to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. You might need to have this procedure more than once to correct your heart rhythm.\r\n        \r\n          Ablation: Your doctor burns off the tiny parts of your heart that are causing the abnormal beats. She threads a thin tube, called a catheter, through a blood vessel in your leg or groin up to your heart.\r\n        Energy travels through the tube. It burns off the areas of tissue that cause the abnormal signals. Scars form in the burned areas and block any abnormal electrical signals.\r\n        After some ablation procedures, you'll need a pacemaker to keep your heart in rhythm.\r\n      \r\n        Surgery\r\n        This might be an option if your symptoms are severe or you can't take medicine to treat AFib.\r\n        \r\n          Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion: Most strokes in people with AFib happen when blood clots form in the upper left part of their heart, the left atrium. LAA occlusion seals off this part of the heart to prevent blood clots and strokes. Your doctor can do surgery or use a catheter that she inserts into a blood vessel in your leg.Maze procedure: During this type of surgery, the doctor makes very small cuts in the top part of your heart. After she sews up the cuts, scar tissue forms.\r\n        This scar tissue prevents the abnormal signals that cause AFib. Some people will need a pacemaker after maze surgery.\r\n      \r\n        Treating the Causes of AFib\r\n        If problems such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, or an overactive thyroid caused your AFib, you'll need to treat the underlying cause. Your doctor might prescribe medications to get those conditions under control.\r\n        Your doctor may also recommend screening and treatment for sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night.\r\n        You might also need to make these changes to your daily life to keep your heart healthy:\r\n        \r\n          Limit sugar, salt, and fat in your diet\r\n          \r\n            Quit smoking\r\n          \r\n          Cut down on alcohol and caffeine\r\n          \r\n            Exercise and eat healthier to control your weight\r\n          Avoid certain cough and cold medicines that contain stimulants, which make your heart beat faster\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by James  Beckerman, MD, FACC on October 09, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: \"Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.\"\r\n            American Heart Association: \"Atrial Fibrillation Medications,\" \"Non-surgical Procedures for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF),\" \"Surgical Procedures for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF),\" \"What is Atrial Fibrillation (AFib or AF)?\"\r\n            Cleveland Clinic: \"Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\"\r\n            National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: \"How Is Atrial Fibrillation Treated?\" \"What is Cardioversion?\"\r\n            The Society of Thoracic Surgeons: \"Atrial Fibrillation Surgery -- Maze Procedure.\"\r\n            UAB Medicine: \"Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion.\"\r\n            Mayo Clinic: Sleep Apnea.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Amputation Overview", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Amputation is the surgical removal of all or part of a limb or extremity such as an arm, leg, foot, hand, toe, or finger.\r\n        About 1.8 million Americans are living with amputations. Amputation of the leg -- either above or below the knee -- is the most common amputation surgery.\r\n      \r\n        Reasons for Amputation\r\n        There are many reasons an amputation may be necessary. The most common is poor circulation because of damage or narrowing of the arteries, called peripheral arterial disease. Without adequate blood flow, the body's cells cannot get oxygen and nutrients they need from the bloodstream. As a result, the affected tissue begins to die and infection may set in.\r\n        Other causes for amputation may include:\r\n        \r\n          Severe injury (from a vehicle accident or serious burn, for example)\r\n          Cancerous tumor in the bone or muscle of the limb\r\n          Serious infection that does not get better with antibiotics or other treatment\r\n          Thickening of nerve tissue, called a neuroma\r\n          \r\n            Frostbite\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        The Amputation Procedure\r\n        An amputation usually requires a hospital stay of five to 14 days or more, depending on the surgery and complications. The procedure itself may vary, depending on the limb or extremity being amputated and the patient's general health.\r\n        Amputation may be done under general anesthesia (meaning the patient is asleep) or with spinal anesthesia, which numbs the body from the waist down.\r\n        When performing an amputation, the surgeon removes all damaged tissue while leaving as much healthy tissue as possible.\r\n        A doctor may use several methods to determine where to cut and how much tissue to remove. These include:\r\n        \r\n          Checking for a pulse close to where the surgeon is planning to cut\r\n          Comparing skin temperatures of the affected limb with those of a healthy limb\r\n          Looking for areas of reddened skin\r\n          Checking to see if the skin near the site where the surgeon is planning to cut is still sensitive to touch\r\n        \r\n        During the procedure itself, the surgeon will:\r\n        \r\n          Remove the diseased tissue and any crushed bone\r\n          Smooth uneven areas of bone\r\n          Seal off blood vessels and nerves\r\n          Cut and shape muscles so that the stump, or end of the limb, will be able to have an artificial limb (prosthesis) attached to it\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        The surgeon may choose to close the wound right away by sewing the skin flaps (called a closed amputation). Or the surgeon may leave the site open for several days in case there's a need to remove additional tissue.\r\n        The surgical team then places a sterile dressing on the wound and may place a stocking over the stump to hold drainage tubes or bandages. The doctor may place the limb in traction, in which a device holds it in position, or may use a splint.\r\n      \r\n        Recovery From Amputation\r\n        Recovery from amputation depends on the type of procedure and anesthesia used.\r\n        In the hospital, the staff changes the dressings on the wound or teaches the patient to change them. The doctor monitors wound healing and any conditions that might interfere with healing, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. The doctor prescribes medications to ease pain and help prevent infection.\r\n        If the patient has problems with phantom pain (a sense of pain in the amputated limb) or grief over the lost limb, the doctor will prescribe medication and/or counseling, as necessary.\r\n        \r\n          Physical therapy, beginning with gentle, stretching exercises, often begins soon after surgery. Practice with the artificial limb may begin as soon as 10 to 14 days after surgery.\r\n        Ideally, the wound should fully heal in about four to eight weeks. But the physical and emotional adjustment to losing a limb can be a long process. Long-term recovery and rehabilitation will include:\r\n        \r\n          Exercises to improve muscle strength and control\r\n          Activities to help restore the ability to carry out daily activities and promote independence\r\n          Use of artificial limbs and assistive devices\r\n          Emotional support, including counseling, to help with grief over the loss of the limb and adjustment to the new body image\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Carol  DerSarkissian on February 25, 2016\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            UAB Medicine: \"Amputation.\"\r\n            University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences: \"Amputation Procedure.\"\r\n            VascularWeb: \"Amputation.\"\r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2016 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "Athlete's Foot", "content": "\r\n        What is athlete's foot?\r\n        Athlete's foot is a rash\r\n\t\t\t on the skin of the foot. It is the most common\r\n\t\t\t fungal skin infection. There are three main types of\r\n\t\t\t athlete's foot. Each type affects different parts of the foot and may look\r\n\t\t\t different. \r\n      \r\n        What causes athlete's foot?\r\n        Athlete's foot is\r\n\t\t\t caused by a\r\n\t\t\t fungus that grows on or in the top layer of skin.\r\n\t\t\t Fungi (plural of fungus) grow best in warm, wet places, such as the area\r\n\t\t\t between the toes.\r\n         Athlete's foot spreads easily. You can get it\r\n\t\t\t by touching the toes or feet of a person who has it. But most often, people get\r\n\t\t\t it by walking barefoot on contaminated surfaces near swimming pools or in\r\n\t\t\t locker rooms. The fungi then grow in your shoes, especially if your shoes are\r\n\t\t\t so tight that air cannot move around your feet.\r\n         If you touch\r\n\t\t\t something that has fungi on it, you can spread athlete's foot to other\r\n\t\t\t peopleeven if you don't get the infection yourself. Some people are more\r\n\t\t\t likely than others to get athlete's foot. Experts don't know why this is. After\r\n\t\t\t you have had athlete's foot, you are more likely to get it again.\r\n      \r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        Athlete's foot can make\r\n\t\t\t your feet and the skin between your toes burn and itch. The skin may peel and\r\n\t\t\t crack. Your symptoms can depend on the type of athlete's foot you have.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Toe web infectionToe web infection \r\n\t\t\t\tusually occurs between the fourth and fifth toes. The skin becomes scaly,\r\n\t\t\t\tpeels, and cracks. Some people also may have an infection with bacteria. This\r\n\t\t\t\tcan make the skin break down even more.\r\n          \r\n            Moccasin type infectionMoccasin type infection  may start with a little soreness on\r\n\t\t\t\tyour foot. Then the skin on the bottom or heel of your foot can become thick\r\n\t\t\t\tand crack. In bad cases, the toenails get infected and can thicken, crumble,\r\n\t\t\t\tand even fall out. Fungal infection in toenails needs separate\r\n\t\t\t\ttreatment.\r\n          \r\n            Vesicular type infectionVesicular type infection  usually\r\n\t\t\t\tbegins with a sudden outbreak of fluid-filled blisters under the skin.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe blisters are usually on the bottom of the foot. But they can appear\r\n\t\t\t\tanywhere on your foot. You also can get a bacterial infection with this type of\r\n\t\t\t\tathlete's foot.\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        How is athlete's foot diagnosed?\r\n        Most of the time,\r\n\t\t\t a doctor can tell that you have athlete's foot by looking at your feet. He or\r\n\t\t\t she will also ask about your symptoms and any past fungal infections you may\r\n\t\t\t have had. If your athlete's foot looks unusual, or if treatment did not help\r\n\t\t\t you before, your doctor may take a skin or nail sample to test for\r\n\t\t\t fungi.\r\n        Not all skin problems on the foot are athlete's foot. If\r\n\t\t\t you think you have athlete's foot but have never had it before, it's a good\r\n\t\t\t idea to have your doctor look at it.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        You can treat most cases of\r\n\t\t\t athlete's foot at home with over-the-counter lotion, cream, or spray. For bad\r\n\t\t\t cases, your doctor may give you a prescription for pills or for medicine you\r\n\t\t\t put on your skin. Use the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you to.\r\n\t\t\t This will help make sure that you get rid of the infection. You also need to\r\n\t\t\t keep your feet clean and dry. Fungi need wet, warm places to grow.\r\n        You can do some things so you don't get athlete's foot again. Wear shower\r\n\t\t\t sandals in shared areas like locker rooms, and use talcum powder to help keep\r\n\t\t\t your feet dry. Wear sandals or roomy shoes made of materials that allow\r\n\t\t\t moisture to escape.\r\n      \r\n        Frequently Asked Questions\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Learning about athlete's foot:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What is athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What causes it?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How do I prevent athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the symptoms of athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What happens in athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What increases my risk for getting it?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Being diagnosed:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Who can diagnose athlete's foot?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is it diagnosed?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Getting treatment:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  How is athlete's foot treated?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What medicines will I need to take?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Living with athlete's foot:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do to treat athlete's foot at home?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  When should I call my doctor?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.

{"topic": "Angina", "content": "\r\n        If you feel pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign.\r\n        The chest pain happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's occurs when something blocks the arteries or there's a decreased blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\r\n        \r\n          Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have it. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack.\r\n        There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control it. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need whats called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.\r\n        There are different types of angina:\r\n        \r\n          Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\r\n        \r\n          Unstable angina. You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.\r\n        \r\n          Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.\r\n      \r\n        Causes\r\n        Angina is usually due to heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.\r\n        Other, less common causes of chest pain include:\r\n        \r\n          A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\r\n          An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)\r\n          Narrowing of a valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)\r\n          Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)\r\n          Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)\r\n        \r\n      Continued\r\n        Symptoms\r\n        Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:\r\n        \r\n          Aching\r\n          Burning\r\n          Discomfort\r\n          Feeling of fullness in the chest\r\n          Heaviness\r\n          Pressure\r\n          Squeezing\r\n        \r\n        Youre likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.\r\n        It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.\r\n        Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.\r\n        One study found that women were more likely to use the words \"pressing\" or \"crushing\" to describe the feeling.\r\n        Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse.\r\n      \r\n        Questions for Your Doctor\r\n        \r\n          Do I need any more tests?\r\n          What type of angina do I have?\r\n          Do I have heart damage?\r\n          What treatment do you recommend?\r\n          How will it make me feel?\r\n          What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack?\r\n          Are there activities I shouldn't do?\r\n          Will changing my diet help?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Treatment\r\n        It depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help blood flow better and control symptoms.\r\n        Your doctor might prescribe medicines to:\r\n        \r\n          Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart\r\n          Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard\r\n          Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart\r\n          Prevent blood clots\r\n        \r\n        If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:\r\n        \r\n          Angioplasty\r\n          /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. Some stents have medicine that helps keep the artery from getting blocked again.\r\n      Continued\r\n        The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. Youll probably stay overnight at the hospital.\r\n        \r\n          Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. The surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.\r\n        You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover.\r\n      \r\n        Taking Care of Yourself\r\n        You can still lead an active life, but it's important that you listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what youre doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often.\r\n        These lifestyle changes can help protect your heart:\r\n        \r\n          Stop smoking\r\n          . It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.\r\n        \r\n          Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar.\r\n        Also:\r\n        \r\n          Use stress-relieving measures like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax.\r\n          \r\n            Exercise most days of the week.\r\n          See your doctor regularly.\r\n        \r\n        If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Don't wait. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage.\r\n      \r\n        What to Expect\r\n        Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But its treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make smart choices.\r\n        Talk with others who have it. That may help you learn how to feel better.\r\n        Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina. They'll want to know what they can do to help.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Laura J.

{"topic": "Amyloidosis", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          Amyloidosis is a condition in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in your tissues and organs. When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.\r\n      \r\n        Causes and Types of Amyloidosis\r\n        Many different proteins can lead to the formation of amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to significant health problems. The type of protein and where it collects determines the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area.\r\n        There are different types of amyloidosis, including:\r\n        \r\n          Primary (systemic AL) amyloidosis. This occurs without a known cause, but it has been seen in people with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. This is the most common type of amyloidosis. \"Systemic\" means it affects the entire body. The most commonly affected body parts are the kidney, heart, liver, intestines, and certain nerves. AL stands for \"amyloid light chains,\" which is the type of protein responsible for this type of amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          Secondary (systemic AA) amyloidosis. This is the result of another chronic inflammatory disease, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and certain cancers. It most commonly affects the spleen, kidneys, liver, adrenal gland, and lymph nodes. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type of amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can occur in many different tissues, but most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons.\r\n        \r\n          Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis (AF). This is a rare form that is passed down through families. It is caused by an abnormal amyloid transthyretin (TTR) protein, which is made in the liver. This protein is responsible for the most common forms of hereditary amyloidosis.\r\n        \r\n          Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). This is caused deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It occurs most commonly in older men.\r\n        \r\n          Organ-specific amyloidosis. This is cause deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis).\r\n        While some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely involved in systemic amyloidosis.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Risk Factors for Amyloidosis\r\n        Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis increases as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma.\r\n        Amyloidosis may also occur in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time (see \"Dialysis-related amyloidosis\" above). \r\n      \r\n        Symptoms of Amyloidosis\r\n        Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of different health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis.\r\n        General symptoms of amyloidosis may include:\r\n        \r\n          Changes in skin color\r\n          Clay-colored stools\r\n          \r\n            Fatigue\r\n          \r\n          Feeling of fullness\r\n          \r\n            Joint pain\r\n          \r\n          Low red blood cell count (anemia)\r\n          Shortness of breath\r\n          Swelling of the tongue\r\n          Tingling and numbness in legs and feet\r\n          Weak hand grip\r\n          \r\n            Weakness\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Weight loss\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Cardiac (Heart) Amyloidosis\r\n        Amyloid deposits in the heart can make the walls of the heart muscle stiff. They can also make the heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump. If amyloidosis affects your heart, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Shortness of breath with light activity\r\n          An irregular heartbeat\r\n          \r\n            Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis\r\n        Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes.\r\n          High levels of protein in your urine.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis\r\n        Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the muscle contractions that help move food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Decreased appetite\r\n          \r\n            Diarrhea\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Nausea\r\n          \r\n          \r\n            Stomach pain\r\n          \r\n          Weight loss\r\n        \r\n        Liver involvement can cause liver enlargement, fluid buildup in the body, and abnormal liver function tests.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Amyloid Neuropathy\r\n        Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have:\r\n        \r\n          Balance problems\r\n          Problems controlling your bladder and bowel\r\n          \r\n            Sweating problems\r\n          Tingling and weakness\r\n          Light-headedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure\r\n        \r\n        Amyloidosis can also involve other organs including the lungs, skin, and spleen.\r\n      \r\n        Diagnosing Amyloidosis\r\n        A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis.\r\n        There is no blood test to detect amyloidosis. Sophisticated laboratory techniques called electrophoresis or free light chain assays may reveal early evidence of some amyloid proteins. \r\n        A biopsy is needed to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and determine the specific type of protein involved in the disease. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from the abdominal fat pad, or sometimes the mouth, rectal, or other involved organs. It is not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits.\r\n        Genetic testing will be done if your health care provider suspects you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different than for other types of the disease.\r\n        Other blood, urine, and imaging tests will be done to check organ function.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Amyloidosis Treatment\r\n        There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to suppress the development of the amyloid-forming protein, and to manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition.\r\n        Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected.\r\n        \r\n          High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in those with primary AL amyloidosis who have no more than two major organs damaged. Chemotherapy medicines alone are used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis.\r\n          Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation.\r\n          \r\n            Liver transplant may stop the disease in those with hereditary amyloidosis.\r\n          A kidney or heart transplant may also be recommended.\r\n        \r\n        Other treatments to help with symptoms may involve:\r\n        \r\n          Diuretic medicine to remove excess water from your body\r\n          Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking in those who have swelling of the tongue \r\n          \r\n            Compression stockings to relieve swelling in the legs or feet\r\n           Diet modifications, especially for those with gastrointestinal amyloidosis\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What to Expect\r\n        Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment is important and can help improve survival. Without treatment, many patients die within two years of diagnosis.\r\n        Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to investigate new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can participate in, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term \"amyloidosis.\"\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by David T.

{"topic": "Alzheimer's Symptoms", "content": "\r\n        The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease often come on slowly. It might start when someone has trouble recalling things that just happened or putting thoughts into words. But over time, the problems get worse. People in the later stages of the disease usually cant live alone or care for themselves.\r\n        There are three main phases of Alzheimer's: mild, moderate, and severe. Each stage has its own set of symptoms.\r\n      \r\n        Mild Alzheimer's\r\n        The first stage usually lasts from 2 to 4 years. The symptoms include:\r\n        \r\n          Having less energy and drive to do things\r\n          Less interest in work and social activities and spending more time just sitting, watching TV, or sleeping\r\n          Loss of recent memories, like forgetting conversations and events that just happened\r\n          Language problems, like trouble putting their thoughts into words or understanding others\r\n          Mild coordination problems, such as trouble writing or using familiar objects.\r\n          A hard time with everyday tasks, such as following a recipe or balancing a checkbook\r\n          Mood swings that involve depression or a lack of interest\r\n          Trouble with driving, like getting lost on familiar routes\r\n        \r\n        When a person has one or a few of these issues, it doesnt necessarily mean he has Alzheimer's. There are other medical conditions that can cause the same problems, such as:\r\n        \r\n          Conditions that affect metabolism, such as a thyroid problem\r\n          \r\n            Drug abuse\r\n          \r\n          Taking medications that dont work well together\r\n          \r\n            Parkinson's disease\r\n          \r\n          Stress\r\n          \r\n            Depression\r\n          \r\n        \r\n        A doctor can check on these symptoms and do tests to know if a person has Alzheimers or something else.\r\n      \r\n        Moderate Alzheimer's\r\n        This is when memory loss gets worse and starts to cause problems in daily life. This stage can last from 2 to 10 years.\r\n        Someone with moderate Alzheimer's may start to forget details about his life, like where he went to high school or when he got married. He may not recognize or remember family members and friends. He might also forget where he leaves things and cant retrace his steps to find them.\r\n        Other symptoms at this stage can include:\r\n        \r\n          Rambling speech\r\n          Trouble coming up with the right words and using the wrong ones\r\n          A hard time planning or solving problems\r\n          Confusion about time or place. He may get lost in places hes been before. Once hes there, he may not know how or why he got to that place.\r\n          Not dressing for the weather\r\n          Getting angry or upset easily, sometimes lashing out at family or caregivers\r\n          \r\n            Trouble sleeping\r\n          \r\n          Wandering\r\n          Delusions, such as thinking a caregiver is trying to hurt him\r\n        \r\n        Some people with moderate Alzheimers also become more aware that theyre losing control of their lives, which can make them even more frustrated or depressed.\r\n      Continued\r\n        Severe Alzheimer's\r\n        The third stage, also known as late Alzheimer's, is the most severe. It typically lasts 1 to 3 years.\r\n        People in this phase might have some or all of these symptoms:\r\n        \r\n          Major confusion about whats in the past and whats happening now\r\n          Cant express themselves, remember, or process information\r\n          Problems with swallowing and control of their bladder and bowels\r\n          \r\n            Weight loss, seizures, skin infections, and other illnesses\r\n          Extreme mood swings\r\n          Seeing, hearing, or feeling things that arent really there, called hallucinations\r\n          Cant move easily on their own\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Alzheimer's or Normal Aging?\r\n        Just about everyone has minor memory glitches as they get older. If someone forgets a name or why he walked into the kitchen, that doesn't mean he has Alzheimer's.\r\n        The main problem that defines the disease is trouble planning and handling day-to-day tasks, like paying bills, managing a checkbook, or using familiar appliances around the house.\r\n      \r\n        What You Can Do\r\n        If you think you notice the signs of Alzheimers in yourself or a loved one, the best thing to do is to talk to a doctor. He can let you know what the symptoms mean and what your options are for treating them.\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference\r\n          Reviewed by Richard  Senelick, MD on February 28, 2015\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          Sources\r\n          \r\n            SOURCES:\r\n            Alzheimer's Association: \"10 Early signs & Symptoms of Alzheimer's\" and \"Principles for a Dignified Diagnosis.\"\r\n            Helpguide.org: \"Alzheimer's Disease.\"\r\n            Alzheimer's Disease Research: \"Alzheimer's Symptoms & Stages.\r\n            National Institute on Aging: \"About Alzheimer's Disease: Symptoms.\"\r\n            Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation: \"Top Ten Alzheimer's Signs and Symptoms.\"\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n         2015 WebMD, LLC.

{"topic": "ACL Injuries", "content": "\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        What is an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury?\r\n        An anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, injury is a tear in one of the knee ligaments that joins the upper leg bone with the lower leg bone . The ACL keeps the knee stable. \r\n        Injuries range from mild, such as a small tear, to severe, such as when the ligament tears completely or when the ligament and part of the bone separate from the rest of the bone.\r\n         Without treatment, the injured ACL is less able to control knee movement, and the bones are more likely to rub against each other. This is called chronic ACL deficiency. The abnormal bone movement can also damage the tissue (cartilage ) that covers the ends of the bones and can trap and tear the pads (menisci ) that cushion the knee joints. This damage can lead to osteoarthritis.\r\n         Sometimes other knee ligaments or parts of the knee are also injured. This includes cartilage such as the menisci, or bones in the knee joint, which can be broken. \r\n      \r\n        What causes an ACL injury?\r\n        Your ACL can be injured if your knee joint is bent backward, twisted, or bent side to side. The chance of injury is higher if more than one of these movements occurs at the same time. Contact (being hit by another person or object) also can cause an ACL injury.\r\n        An ACL injury often occurs during sports. The injury can happen when your foot is firmly planted on the ground and a sudden force hits your knee while your leg is straight or slightly bent. This can happen when you are changing direction rapidly, slowing down when running, or landing from a jump. This type of injury is common in soccer, skiing, football, and other sports with lots of stop-and-go movements, jumping, or weaving. Falling off a ladder or missing a step on a staircase are other likely causes. Like any other body part, the ACL becomes weaker with age. So a tear happens more easily in people older than age 40.\r\n      Continued\r\n        What are the symptoms?\r\n        Symptoms of an acute ACL injury include:\r\n        \r\n          Feeling or hearing a pop in the knee at the time of injury.\r\n           Pain on the outside and back of the knee.\r\n           The knee swelling within the first few hours of the injury. This may be a sign of bleeding inside the knee joint. Swelling that occurs suddenly is usually a sign of a serious knee injury.\r\n           Limited knee movement because of pain or swelling or both.\r\n           The knee feeling unstable, buckling, or giving out.\r\n        \r\n        After an acute injury, you will probably have to stop whatever you are doing because of the pain, but you may be able to walk.\r\n         The main symptom of chronic ACL deficiency is the knee buckling or giving out, sometimes with pain and swelling. This can happen when an ACL injury is not treated. \r\n      \r\n        How is an ACL injury diagnosed?\r\n        Your doctor can tell whether you have an ACL injury by asking questions about your past health and examining your knee. The doctor may ask: How did you injure your knee? Have you had any other knee injuries? Your doctor will check for stability, movement, and tenderness in both the injured and uninjured knee.\r\n         You may need X-rays, which can show damage to the knee bones. Or you may need other imaging tests, such as an MRI. An MRI can show damage to ligaments, tendons, muscles, and knee cartilage. Arthroscopy may also be done. During arthroscopy, your doctor inserts surgical tools through one or more small cuts (incisions) in the knee to look at the inside of the knee.\r\n      \r\n        How is it treated?\r\n        Start first aid right away. These first-aid tips will reduce swelling and pain. Use the RICE method. The letters stand for Rest the knee, put Ice on it, use an elastic bandage to give gentle Compression to the knee, and Elevate the leg by propping it up above the level of your heart. And at first it's also important to move your leg as little as possible. Take over-the-counter pain medicine.\r\n      Continued\r\n         You may need to walk with crutches and use a knee immobilizer to keep your knee still for the first few days after the injury.\r\n         Your knee will need to be checked by your doctor. It's important to get treatment. If you don't, the injury may become a long-lasting problem. There are two ways to treat the injury: \r\n        \r\n          Exercises and training, also called rehab. It takes several months of rehab for your knee to get better.\r\n           Surgery. You and your doctor can decide if rehab is enough or if surgery is right for you. \r\n        \r\n        If you have surgery, you will also have several months of rehab afterward.\r\n         Your treatment will depend on how much of the ACL is torn, whether other parts of the knee are injured, how active you are, your age, your overall health, and how long ago the injury occurred.\r\n         There are three main treatment goals: \r\n        \r\n          Make the knee stable if it is unsteady, or at least make it stable enough to do your daily activities.\r\n           Make your knee strong enough to do all the activities you used to do.\r\n           Reduce the chance that your knee will be damaged more.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        How can you prevent ACL injuries?\r\n        The best way to prevent ACL injuries is to stretch and strengthen the leg muscles, especially the front and back muscles of the thigh (quadriceps and hamstrings).\r\n         Here are other things you can do that may help prevent ACL injuries:\r\n        \r\n           Avoid wearing shoes with cleats in contact sports.\r\n           Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes.\r\n          Avoid sports that involve lots of twisting and contact.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Frequently Asked Questions\r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Learning about anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What are the ACL and an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What causes an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Can I prevent it?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the symptoms?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What happens in an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What increases my risk?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Why do women have more ACL injuries than men?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury classified?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Being diagnosed:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Who can diagnose an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury diagnosed?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Getting treatment:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  How is an ACL injury treated?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What medicines will I need to take?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Will I need surgery?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do to treat an ACL injury at home?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                   Should I have surgery for my ACL injury?\r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Living with an ACL injury:\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  What can I do at home for an ACL injury?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  When should I call my doctor?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Will I be able to return to sports?\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  What are the long-term consequences?\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise\r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          This information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.\r\nHealthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this\r\ninformation. 1995-2015 Healthwise, Incorporated.
